<h2>To the Reader</h2>
<p>There existed formerly, in diplomatic circles, a curious 
custom, since fallen into disuse, entitled the P&ecirc;le 
M&ecirc;le, contrived doubtless by some distracted Master of 
Ceremonies to quell the endless jealousies and quarrels for 
precedence between courtiers and diplomatists of contending 
pretensions.&nbsp; Under this rule no rank was recognized, each 
person being allowed at banquet, f&ecirc;te, or other public 
ceremony only such place as he had been ingenious or fortunate 
enough to obtain.</p>
<p>Any one wishing to form an idea of the confusion that ensued, 
of the intrigues and expedients resorted to, not only in 
procuring prominent places, but also in ensuring the integrity of
the P&ecirc;le M&ecirc;le, should glance over the amusing memoirs
of M. de S&eacute;gur.</p>
<p>The aspiring nobles and ambassadors, harassed by this constant
preoccupation, had little time or inclination left for any 
serious pursuit, since, to take a moment&rsquo;s repose or an 
hour&rsquo;s breathing space was to risk falling behind in the 
endless and aimless race.&nbsp; Strange as it may appear, the 
knowledge that they owed place and preferment more to chance or 
intrigue than to any personal merit or inherited right, instead 
of lessening the value of the prizes for which all were striving,
seemed only to enhance them in the eyes of the competitors.</p>
<p>Success was the unique standard by which they gauged their 
fellows.&nbsp; Those who succeeded revelled in the adulation of 
their friends, but when any one failed, the fickle crowd passed 
him by to bow at more fortunate feet.</p>
<p>No better picture could be found of the &ldquo;world&rdquo; of
to-day, a perpetual P&ecirc;le M&ecirc;le, where such advantages 
only are conceded as we have been sufficiently enterprising to 
obtain, and are strong or clever enough to keep&mdash;a constant 
competition, a daily steeplechase, favorable to daring spirits 
and personal initiative but with the defect of keeping frail 
humanity ever on the qui vive.</p>
<p>Philosophers tell us, that we should seek happiness only in 
the calm of our own minds, not allowing external conditions or 
the opinions of others to influence our ways.&nbsp; This lofty 
detachment from environment is achieved by very few.&nbsp; 
Indeed, the philosophers themselves (who may be said to have 
invented the art of &ldquo;posing&rdquo;) were generally as vain 
as peacocks, profoundly pre-occupied with the verdict of their 
contemporaries and their position as regards posterity.</p>
<p>Man is born gregarious and remains all his life a herding 
animal.&nbsp; As one keen observer has written, &ldquo;So great 
is man&rsquo;s horror of being alone that he will seek the 
society of those he neither likes nor respects sooner than be 
left to his own.&rdquo;&nbsp; The laws and conventions that 
govern men&rsquo;s intercourse have, therefore, formed a tempting
subject for the writers of all ages.&nbsp; Some have labored 
hoping to reform their generation, others have written to offer 
solutions for life&rsquo;s many problems.</p>
<p>Beaumarchais, whose penetrating wit left few subjects 
untouched, makes his Figaro put the subject aside with &ldquo;Je 
me presse de rire de tout, de peur d&rsquo;&ecirc;tre 
oblig&egrave; d&rsquo;en pleurer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The author of this little volume pretends to settle no 
disputes, aims at inaugurating no reforms.&nbsp; He has lightly 
touched on passing topics and jotted down, &ldquo;to point a 
moral or adorn a tale,&rdquo; some of the more obvious foibles 
and inconsistencies of our American ways.&nbsp; If a stray bit of
philosophy has here and there slipped in between the lines, it is
mostly of the laughing &ldquo;school,&rdquo; and used more in 
banter than in blame.</p>
<p>This much abused &ldquo;world&rdquo; is a fairly agreeable 
place if you do not take it seriously.&nbsp; Meet it with a 
friendly face and it will smile gayly back at you, but do not ask
of it what it cannot give, or attribute to its verdicts more 
importance than they deserve.</p>

<p><i>Newport</i>, <i>November first</i>, 1897</p>
<h2>No. 1&mdash;Charm</h2>
<p>Women endowed by nature with the indescribable quality we call
&ldquo;charm&rdquo; (for want of a better word), are the supreme 
development of a perfected race, the last word, as it were, of 
civilization; the flower of their kind, crowning centuries of 
growing refinement and cultivation.&nbsp; Other women may unite a
thousand brilliant qualities, and attractive attributes, may be 
beautiful as Astart&eacute; or witty as Madame de Montespan, 
those endowed with the power of charm, have in all ages and under
every sky, held undisputed rule over the hearts of their 
generation.</p>
<p>When we look at the portraits of the enchantresses whom 
history tells us have ruled the world by their charm, and swayed 
the destinies of empires at their fancy, we are astonished to 
find that they have rarely been beautiful.&nbsp; From Cleopatra 
or Mary of Scotland down to Lola Montez, the tell-tale coin or 
canvas reveals the same marvellous fact.&nbsp; We wonder how 
these women attained such influence over the men of their day, 
their husbands or lovers.&nbsp; We would do better to look around
us, or inward, and observe what is passing in our own hearts.</p>
<p>Pause, reader mine, a moment and reflect.&nbsp; Who has held 
the first place in your thoughts, filled your soul, and 
influenced your life?&nbsp; Was she the most beautiful of your 
acquaintances, the radiant vision that dazzled your boyish 
eyes?&nbsp; Has she not rather been some gentle, quiet woman whom
you hardly noticed the first time your paths crossed, but who 
gradually grew to be a part of your life&mdash;to whom you 
instinctively turned for consolation in moments of 
discouragement, for counsel in your difficulties, and whose 
welcome was the bright moment in your day, looked forward to 
through long hours of toil and worry?</p>
<p>In the hurly-burly of life we lose sight of so many things our
fathers and mothers clung to, and have drifted so far away from 
their gentle customs and simple, home-loving habits, that one 
wonders what impression our society would make on a woman of a 
century ago, could she by some spell be dropped into the swing of
modern days.&nbsp; The good soul would be apt to find it rather a
far cry from the quiet pleasures of her youth, to &ldquo;a 
ladies&rsquo; amateur bicycle race&rdquo; that formed the 
attraction recently at a summer resort.</p>
<p>That we should have come to think it natural and proper for a 
young wife and mother to pass her mornings at golf, lunching at 
the club-house to &ldquo;save time,&rdquo; returning home only 
for a hurried change of toilet to start again on a bicycle or for
a round of calls, an occupation that will leave her just the 
half-hour necessary to slip into a dinner gown, and then for her 
to pass the evening in dancing or at the card-table, shows, when 
one takes the time to think of it, how unconsciously we have 
changed, and (with all apologies to the gay hostesses and 
graceful athletes of to-day) not for the better.</p>
<p>It is just in the subtle quality of charm that the women of 
the last ten years have fallen away from their elder 
sisters.&nbsp; They have been carried along by a love of sport, 
and by the set of fashion&rsquo;s tide, not stopping to ask 
themselves whither they are floating.&nbsp; They do not realize 
all the importance of their acts nor the true meaning of their 
metamorphosis.</p>
<p>The dear creatures should be content, for they have at last 
escaped from the bondage of ages, have broken their chains, and 
vaulted over their prison walls.&nbsp; &ldquo;Lords and 
masters&rdquo; have gradually become very humble and obedient 
servants, and the &ldquo;love, honour, and obey&rdquo; of the 
marriage service might now more logically be spoken by the man; 
on the lips of the women of to-day it is but a graceful 
&ldquo;<i>fa&ccedil;on de parler</i>,&rdquo; and holds only those
who choose to be bound.</p>
<p>It is not my intention to rail against the short-comings of 
the day.&nbsp; That ungrateful task I leave to sterner moralists,
and hopeful souls who na&iuml;vely imagine they can stem the 
current of an epoch with the barrier of their eloquence, or sweep
back an ocean of innovations by their logic.&nbsp; I should like,
however, to ask my sisters one question: Are they quite sure that
women gain by these changes?&nbsp; Do they imagine, these 
&ldquo;sporty&rdquo; young females in short-cut skirts and 
mannish shirts and ties, that it is seductive to a lover, or a 
husband to see his idol in a violent perspiration, her draggled 
hair blowing across a sunburned face, panting up a long hill in 
front of him on a bicycle, frantic at having lost her race?&nbsp;
Shade of gentle William! who said</p>
<blockquote><p><i>A woman moved</i>, <i>is like a fountain 
troubled</i>,&mdash;<br />
<i>Muddy</i>, <i>ill-seeming</i>, <i>thick</i>, <i>bereft of 
beauty</i>.<br />
<i>And while it is so</i>, <i>none so dry or thirsty</i><br />
<i>Will deign to sip or touch one drop of it</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is the modern girl under the impression that men will be 
contented with poor imitations of themselves, to share their 
homes and be the mothers of their children?&nbsp; She is throwing
away the substance for the shadow!</p>
<p>The moment women step out from the sanctuary of their homes, 
the glamour that girlhood or maternity has thrown around them 
cast aside, that moment will they cease to rule mankind.&nbsp; 
Women may agitate until they have obtained political recognition,
but will awake from their foolish dream of power, realizing too 
late what they have sacrificed to obtain it, that the price has 
been very heavy, and the fruit of their struggles bitter on their
lips.</p>
<p>There are few men, I imagine, of my generation to whom the 
words &ldquo;home&rdquo; and &ldquo;mother&rdquo; have not a 
penetrating charm, who do not look back with softened heart and 
tender thoughts to fireside scenes of evening readings and 
twilight talks at a mother&rsquo;s knee, realizing that the best 
in their natures owes its growth to these influences.</p>
<p>I sometimes look about me and wonder what the word 
&ldquo;mother&rdquo; will mean later, to modern little 
boys.&nbsp; It will evoke, I fear, a confused remembrance of some
centaur-like being, half woman, half wheel, or as it did to 
neglected little Rawdon Crawley, the vision of a radiant creature
in gauze and jewels, driving away to endless 
<i>f&ecirc;tes</i>&mdash;<i>f&ecirc;tes</i> followed by long 
mornings, when he was told not to make any noise, or play too 
loudly, &ldquo;as poor mamma is resting.&rdquo;&nbsp; What other 
memories can the &ldquo;successful&rdquo; woman of to-day hope to
leave in the minds of her children?&nbsp; If the child remembers 
his mother in this way, will not the man who has known and 
perhaps loved her, feel the same sensation of empty futility when
her name is mentioned?</p>
<p>The woman who proposes a game of cards to a youth who comes to
pass an hour in her society, can hardly expect him to carry away 
a particularly tender memory of her as he leaves the house.&nbsp;
The girl who has rowed, ridden, or raced at a man&rsquo;s side 
for days, with the object of getting the better of him at some 
sport or pastime, cannot reasonably hope to be connected in his 
thoughts with ideas more tender or more elevated than 
&ldquo;odds&rdquo; or &ldquo;handicaps,&rdquo; with an 
undercurrent of pique if his unsexed companion has 
&ldquo;downed&rdquo; him successfully.</p>
<p>What man, unless he be singularly dissolute or unfortunate, 
but turns his steps, when he can, towards some dainty parlor 
where he is sure of finding a smiling, soft-voiced woman, whose 
welcome he knows will soothe his irritated nerves and restore the
even balance of his temper, whose charm will work its subtle way 
into his troubled spirit?&nbsp; The wife he loves, or the friend 
he admires and respects, will do more for him in one such quiet 
hour when two minds commune, coming closer to the real man, and 
moving him to braver efforts, and nobler aims, than all the 
beauties and &ldquo;sporty&rdquo; acquaintances of a 
lifetime.&nbsp; No matter what a man&rsquo;s education or taste 
is, none are insensible to such an atmosphere or to the grace and
witchery a woman can lend to the simplest surroundings.&nbsp; She
need not be beautiful or brilliant to hold him in lifelong 
allegiance, if she but possess this magnetism.</p>
<p>Madame R&eacute;camier was a beautiful, but not a brilliant 
woman, yet she held men her slaves for years.&nbsp; To know her 
was to fall under her charm, and to feel it once was to remain 
her adorer for life.&nbsp; She will go down to history as the 
type of a fascinating woman.&nbsp; Being asked once by an 
acquaintance what spell she worked on mankind that enabled her to
hold them for ever at her feet, she laughingly answered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have always found two words sufficient.&nbsp; When a 
visitor comes into my salon, I say, &lsquo;<i>Enfin</i>!&rsquo; 
and when he gets up to go away, I say, 
&lsquo;<i>D&eacute;j&agrave;</i>!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is this wonderful &lsquo;charm&rsquo; he is 
writing about?&rdquo;&nbsp; I hear some sprightly maiden inquire 
as she reads these lines.&nbsp; My dear young lady, if you ask 
the question, you have judged yourself and been found 
wanting.&nbsp; But to satisfy you as far as I can, I will try and
define it&mdash;not by telling you what it is; that is beyond my 
power&mdash;but by negatives, the only way in which subtle 
subjects can be approached.</p>
<p>A woman of charm is never flustered and never 
<i>distraite</i>.&nbsp; She talks little, and rarely of herself, 
remembering that bores are persons who insist on talking about 
themselves.&nbsp; She does not break the thread of a conversation
by irrelevant questions or confabulate in an undertone with the 
servants.&nbsp; No one of her guests receives more of her 
attention than another and none are neglected.&nbsp; She offers 
to each one who speaks the homage of her entire attention.&nbsp; 
She never makes an effort to be brilliant or entertain with her 
wit.&nbsp; She is far too clever for that.&nbsp; Neither does she
volunteer information nor converse about her troubles or her 
ailments, nor wander off into details about people you do not 
know.</p>
<p>She is all things&mdash;to each man she likes, in the best 
sense of that phrase, appreciating his qualities, stimulating him
to better things.</p>
<blockquote><p>&mdash;<i>for his gayer hours</i><br />
<i>She has a voice of gladness and a smile and eloquence of 
beauty</i>; <i>and she glides</i><br />
<i>Into his darker musings with a mild and healing sympathy that 
steals away</i><br />
<i>Their sharpness ere he is aware</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>No. 2&mdash;The Moth and the Star</h2>
<p>The truth of the saying that &ldquo;it is always the 
unexpected that happens,&rdquo; receives in this country a 
confirmation from an unlooked-for quarter, as does the fact of 
human nature being always, discouragingly, the same in spite of 
varied surroundings.&nbsp; This sounds like a paradox, but is an 
exceedingly simple statement easily proved.</p>
<p>That the great mass of Americans, drawn as they are from such 
varied sources, should take any interest in the comings and 
goings or social doings of a small set of wealthy and fashionable
people, is certainly an unexpected development.&nbsp; That to 
read of the amusements and home life of a clique of people with 
whom they have little in common, whose whole education and point 
of view are different from their own, and whom they have rarely 
seen and never expect to meet, should afford the average citizen 
any amusement seems little short of impossible.</p>
<p>One accepts as a natural sequence that abroad (where an 
hereditary nobility have ruled for centuries, and accustomed the 
people to look up to them as the visible embodiment of all that 
is splendid and unattainable in life) such interest should 
exist.&nbsp; That the home-coming of an English or French 
nobleman to his estates should excite the enthusiasm of hundreds 
more or less dependent upon him for their amusement or more 
material advantages; that his marriage to an 
heiress&mdash;meaning to them the re-opening of a long-closed 
<i>ch&acirc;teau</i> and the beginning of a period of prosperity 
for the district&mdash;should excite his neighbors is not to be 
wondered at.</p>
<p>It is well known that whole regions have been made prosperous 
by the residence of a court, witness the wealth and trade brought
into Scotland by the Queen&rsquo;s preference for &ldquo;the Land
of Cakes,&rdquo; and the discontent and poverty in Ireland from 
absenteeism and persistent avoidance of that country by the 
court.&nbsp; But in this land, where every reason for interesting
one class in another seems lacking, that thousands of well-to-do 
people (half the time not born in this hemisphere), should 
delightedly devour columns of incorrect information about New 
York dances and Lenox house-parties, winter cruises, or Newport 
coaching parades, strikes the observer as the 
&ldquo;unexpected&rdquo; in its purest form.</p>
<p>That this interest exists is absolutely certain.&nbsp; During 
a trip in the West, some seasons ago, I was dumbfounded to find 
that the members of a certain New York set were familiarly spoken
of by their first names, and was assailed with all sorts of eager
questions when it was discovered that I knew them.&nbsp; A 
certain young lady, at that time a belle in New York, was 
currently called <i>Sally</i>, and a well-known sportsman 
<i>Fred</i>, by thousands of people who had never seen either of 
them.&nbsp; It seems impossible, does it not?&nbsp; Let us look a
little closer into the reason of this interest, and we shall find
how simple is the apparent paradox.</p>
<p>Perhaps in no country, in all the world, do the immense middle
classes lead such uninteresting lives, and have such limited 
resources at their disposal for amusement or the passing of 
leisure hours.</p>
<p>Abroad the military bands play constantly in the public parks;
the museums and palaces are always open wherein to pass rainy 
Sunday afternoons; every village has its religious 
<i>f&ecirc;tes</i> and local fair, attended with dancing and 
games.&nbsp; All these mental relaxations are lacking in our 
newer civilization; life is stripped of everything that is not 
distinctly practical; the dull round of weekly toil is only 
broken by the duller idleness of an American Sunday.&nbsp; 
Naturally, these people long for something outside of themselves 
and their narrow sphere.</p>
<p>Suddenly there arises a class whose wealth permits them to 
break through the iron circle of work and boredom, who do 
picturesque and delightful things, which appeal directly to the 
imagination; they build a summer residence complete, in six 
weeks, with furniture and bric-a-brac, on the top of a roadless 
mountain; they sail in fairylike yachts to summer seas, and marry
their daughters to the heirs of ducal houses; they float up the 
Nile in dahabeeyah, or pass the &ldquo;month of flowers&rdquo; in
far Japan.</p>
<p>It is but human nature to delight in reading of these 
things.&nbsp; Here the great mass of the people find (and eagerly
seize on), the element of romance lacking in their lives, 
infinitely more enthralling than the doings of any novel&rsquo;s 
heroine.&nbsp; It is real!&nbsp; It is taking place! 
and&mdash;still deeper reason&mdash;in every ambitious American 
heart lingers the secret hope that with luck and good management 
they too may do those very things, or at least that their 
children will enjoy the fortunes they have gained, in just those 
ways.&nbsp; The gloom of the monotonous present is brightened, 
the patient toiler returns to his desk with something definite 
before him&mdash;an objective point&mdash;towards which he can 
struggle; he knows that this is no impossible dream.&nbsp; Dozens
have succeeded and prove to him what energy and enterprise can 
accomplish.</p>
<p>Do not laugh at this suggestion; it is far truer than you 
imagine.&nbsp; Many a weary woman has turned from such reading to
her narrow duties, feeling that life is not all work, and with 
renewed hope in the possibilities of the future.</p>
<p>Doubtless a certain amount of purely idle curiosity is mingled
with the other feelings.&nbsp; I remember quite well showing our 
city sights to a bored party of Western friends, and failing 
entirely to amuse them, when, happening to mention as we drove up
town, &ldquo;there goes Mr. Blank,&rdquo; (naming a prominent 
leader of cotillions), my guests nearly fell over each other and 
out of the carriage in their eagerness to see the gentleman of 
whom they had read so much, and who was, in those days, a power 
in his way, and several times after they expressed the greatest 
satisfaction at having seen him.</p>
<p>I have found, with rare exceptions, and the experience has 
been rather widely gathered all over the country, that this 
interest&mdash;or call it what you will&mdash;has been entirely 
without spite or bitterness, rather the delight of a child in a 
fairy story.&nbsp; For people are rarely envious of things far 
removed from their grasp.&nbsp; You will find that a woman who is
bitter because her neighbor has a girl &ldquo;help&rdquo; or a 
more comfortable cottage, rarely feels envy towards the owners of
opera-boxes or yachts.&nbsp; Such heart-burnings (let us hope 
they are few) are among a class born in the shadow of great 
wealth, and bred up with tastes that they can neither relinquish 
nor satisfy.&nbsp; The large majority of people show only a 
good-natured inclination to chaff, none of the &ldquo;class 
feeling&rdquo; which certain papers and certain politicians try 
to excite.&nbsp; Outside of the large cities with their 
foreign-bred, semi-anarchistic populations, the tone is perfectly
friendly; for the simple reason that it never entered into the 
head of any American to imagine that there <i>was</i> any class 
difference.&nbsp; To him his rich neighbors are simply his lucky 
neighbors, almost his relations, who, starting from a common 
stock, have been able to &ldquo;get there&rdquo; sooner than he 
has done.&nbsp; So he wishes them luck on the voyage in which he 
expects to join them as soon as he has had time to make a 
fortune.</p>
<p>So long as the world exists, or at least until we have 
reformed it and adopted Mr. Bellamy&rsquo;s delightful scheme of 
existence as described in &ldquo;Looking Backward,&rdquo; great 
fortunes will be made, and painful contrasts be seen, especially 
in cities, and it would seem to be the duty of the press to 
soften&mdash;certainly not to sharpen&mdash;the edge of 
discontent.&nbsp; As long as human nature is human nature, and 
the poor care to read of the doings of the more fortunate, by all
means give them the reading they enjoy and demand, but let it be 
written in a kindly spirit so that it may be a cultivation as 
well as a recreation.&nbsp; Treat this perfectly natural and 
honest taste honestly and naturally, for, after all, it is</p>
<blockquote><p><i>The desire of the moth for the star</i>,<br />
<i>Of the night for the morrow</i>.<br />
<i>The devotion to something afar</i><br />
<i>From the sphere of our sorrow</i>.</p>

<p>When our parents went to Europe fifty years ago, it was the 
event of a lifetime&mdash;a tour lovingly mapped out in advance 
with advice from travelled friends.&nbsp; Passports were 
procured, books read, wills made, and finally, prayers were 
offered up in church and solemn leave-taking performed.&nbsp; 
Once on the other side, descriptive letters were conscientiously 
written, and eagerly read by friends at home,&mdash;in spite of 
these epistles being on the thinnest of paper and with crossing 
carried to a fine art, for postage was high in the forties.&nbsp;
Above all, a journal was kept.</p>
<p>Such a journal lies before me as I write.&nbsp; Four little 
volumes in worn morocco covers and faded &ldquo;Italian&rdquo; 
writing, more precious than all my other books combined, their 
sight recalls that lost time&mdash;my youth&mdash;when, as a 
reward, they were unlocked that I might look at the drawings, and
the sweetest voice in the world would read to me from them!&nbsp;
Happy, vanished days, that are so far away they seem to have been
in another existence!</p>
<p>The first volume opens with the voyage across the Atlantic, 
made in an American clipper (a model unsurpassed the world over),
which was accomplished in thirteen days, a feat rarely equalled 
now, by sail.&nbsp; Genial Captain Nye was in command.&nbsp; The 
same who later, when a steam propelled vessel was offered him, 
refused, as unworthy of a seaman, &ldquo;to boil a kettle across 
the ocean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Life friendships were made in those little cabins, under the 
swinging lamp the travellers re-read last volumes so as to be 
prepared to appreciate everything on landing.&nbsp; Ireland, 
England and Scotland were visited with an enthusiasm born of 
Scott, the tedium of long coaching journeys being beguiled by the
first &ldquo;numbers&rdquo; of &ldquo;Pickwick,&rdquo; over which
the men of the party roared, but which the ladies did not care 
for, thinking it vulgar, and not to be compared to 
&ldquo;Waverley,&rdquo; &ldquo;Thaddeus of Warsaw,&rdquo; or 
&ldquo;The Mysteries of Udolpho.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A circular letter to our diplomatic agents abroad was 
presented in each city, a rite invariably followed by an 
invitation to dine, for which occasions a black satin frock with 
a low body and a few simple ornaments, including (supreme 
elegance) a diamond cross, were carried in the trunks.&nbsp; In 
London a travelling carriage was bought and stocked, the 
indispensable courier engaged, half guide, half servant, who was 
expected to explore a city, or wait at table, as occasion 
required.&nbsp; Four days were passed between Havre and Paris, 
and the slow progress across Europe was accomplished, Murray in 
one hand and Byron in the other.</p>
<p>One page used particularly to attract my boyish 
attention.&nbsp; It was headed by a na&iuml;ve little drawing of 
the carriage at an Italian inn door, and described how, after the
dangers and discomforts of an Alpine pass, they descended by 
sunny slopes into Lombardy.&nbsp; Oh! the rapture that breathes 
from those simple pages!&nbsp; The vintage scenes, the mid-day 
halt for luncheon eaten in the open air, the afternoon start, the
front seat of the carriage heaped with purple grapes, used to 
fire my youthful imagination and now recalls Madame de 
Sta&euml;l&rsquo;s line on perfect happiness: &ldquo;To be young!
to be in love! to be in Italy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Do people enjoy Europe as much now?&nbsp; I doubt it!&nbsp; It
has become too much a matter of course, a necessary part of the 
routine of life.&nbsp; Much of the bloom is brushed from foreign 
scenes by descriptive books and photographs, that St. 
Mark&rsquo;s or Mt. Blanc has become as familiar to a 
child&rsquo;s eye as the house he lives in, and in consequence 
the reality now instead of being a revelation is often a 
disappointment.</p>
<p>In my youth, it was still an event to cross.&nbsp; I remember 
my first voyage on the old side-wheeled <i>Scotia</i>, and 
Captain Judkins in a wheeled chair, and a perpetual bad temper, 
being pushed about the deck; and our delight, when the inevitable
female asking him (three days out) how far we were from land, got
the answer &ldquo;about a mile!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed!&nbsp; How interesting!&nbsp; In which 
direction?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In that direction, madam,&rdquo; shouted the captain, 
pointing downward as he turned his back to her.</p>
<p>If I remember, we were then thirteen days getting to 
Liverpool, and made the acquaintance on board of the people with 
whom we travelled during most of that winter.&nbsp; Imagine 
anyone now making an acquaintance on board a steamer!&nbsp; In 
those simple days people depended on the friendships made at 
summer hotels or boarding-houses for their visiting list.&nbsp; 
At present, when a girl comes out, her mother presents her to 
everybody she will be likely to know if she were to live a 
century.&nbsp; In the seventies, ladies cheerfully shared their 
state-rooms with women they did not know, and often became 
friends in consequence; but now, unless a certain deck-suite can 
be secured, with bath and sitting-room, on one or two particular 
&ldquo;steamers,&rdquo; the great lady is in despair.&nbsp; Yet 
our mothers were quite as refined as the present generation, only
they took life simply, as they found it.</p>
<p>Children are now taken abroad so young, that before they have 
reached an age to appreciate what they see, Europe has become to 
them a twice-told tale.&nbsp; So true is this, that a receipt for
making children good Americans is to bring them up abroad.&nbsp; 
Once they get back here it is hard to entice them away again.</p>
<p>With each improvement in the speed of our steamers, something 
of the glamour of Europe vanishes.&nbsp; The crowds that yearly 
rush across see and appreciate less in a lifetime than our 
parents did in their one tour abroad.&nbsp; A good lady of my 
acquaintance was complaining recently how much Paris bored 
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can you do to pass the time?&rdquo; she 
asked.&nbsp; I innocently answered that I knew nothing so 
entrancing as long mornings passed at the Louvre.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, I do that too,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;but 
I like the &lsquo;Bon March&eacute;&rsquo; best!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A trip abroad has become a purely social function to a large 
number of wealthy Americans, including &ldquo;presentation&rdquo;
in London and a winter in Rome or Cairo.&nbsp; And just as a 
&ldquo;smart&rdquo; Englishman is sure to tell you that he has 
never visited the &ldquo;Tower,&rdquo; it has become good form to
ignore the sight-seeing side of Europe; hundreds of New Yorkers 
never seeing anything of Paris beyond the Rue de la Paix and the 
Bois.&nbsp; They would as soon think of going to Cluny or St. 
Denis as of visiting the museum in our park!</p>
<p>Such people go to Fontainebleau because they are buying 
furniture, and they wish to see the best models.&nbsp; They go to
Versailles on the coach and &ldquo;do&rdquo; the Palace during 
the half-hour before luncheon.&nbsp; Beyond that, enthusiasm 
rarely carries them.&nbsp; As soon as they have settled 
themselves at the Bristol or the Rhin begins the endless 
treadmill of leaving cards on all the people just seen at home, 
and whom they will meet again in a couple of months at Newport or
Bar Harbor.&nbsp; This duty and the all-entrancing occupation of 
getting clothes fills up every spare hour.&nbsp; Indeed, clothes 
seem to pervade the air of Paris in May, the conversation rarely 
deviating from them.&nbsp; If you meet a lady you know looking 
ill, and ask the cause, it generally turns out to be &ldquo;four 
hours a day standing to be fitted.&rdquo;&nbsp; Incredible as it 
may seem, I have been told of one plain maiden lady, who makes a 
trip across, spring and autumn, with the sole object of getting 
her two yearly outfits.</p>
<p>Remembering the hundreds of cultivated people whose dream in 
life (often unrealized from lack of means) has been to go abroad 
and visit the scenes their reading has made familiar, and knowing
what such a trip would mean to them, and how it would be looked 
back upon during the rest of an obscure life, I felt it almost a 
duty to &ldquo;suppress&rdquo; a wealthy female (doubtless an 
American cousin of Lady Midas) when she informed me, the other 
day, that decidedly she would not go abroad this spring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not necessary.&nbsp; Worth has my 
measures!&rdquo;</p>
<h2>No. 4&mdash;The Outer and the Inner Woman</h2>
<p>It is a sad commentary on our boasted civilization that cases 
of shoplifting occur more and more frequently each year, in which
the delinquents are women of education and refinement, or at 
least belong to families and occupy positions in which one would 
expect to find those qualities!&nbsp; The reason, however, is not
difficult to discover.</p>
<p>In the wake of our hasty and immature prosperity has come (as 
it does to all suddenly enriched societies) a love of 
ostentation, a desire to dazzle the crowd by displays of luxury 
and rich trappings indicative of crude and vulgar 
standards.&nbsp; The newly acquired money, instead of being 
expended for solid comforts or articles which would afford 
lasting satisfaction, is lavished on what can be worn in public, 
or the outer shell of display, while the home table and fireside 
belongings are neglected.&nbsp; A glance around our theatres, or 
at the men and women in our crowded thoroughfares, is sufficient 
to reveal to even a casual observer that the mania for fine 
clothes and what is costly, <i>per se</i>, has become the 
besetting sin of our day and our land.</p>
<p>The tone of most of the papers and of our theatrical 
advertisements reflects this feeling.&nbsp; The amount of money 
expended for a work of art or a new building is mentioned before 
any comment as to its beauty or fitness.&nbsp; A play is spoken 
of as &ldquo;Manager So and So&rsquo;s thirty-thousand-dollar 
production!&rdquo;&nbsp; The fact that a favorite actress will 
appear in four different dresses during the three acts of a 
comedy, each toilet being a special creation designed for her by 
a leading Parisian house, is considered of supreme importance and
is dwelt upon in the programme as a special attraction.</p>
<p>It would be astonishing if the taste of our women were 
different, considering the way clothes are eternally being 
dangled before their eyes.&nbsp; Leading papers publish 
illustrated supplements devoted exclusively to the subject of 
attire, thus carrying temptation into every humble home, and 
suggesting unattainable luxuries.&nbsp; Windows in many of the 
larger shops contain life-sized manikins loaded with the latest 
costly and ephemeral caprices of fashion arranged to catch the 
eye of the poorer class of women, who stand in hundreds gazing at
the display like larks attracted by a mirror!&nbsp; Watch those 
women as they turn away, and listen to their sighs of discontent 
and envy.&nbsp; Do they not tell volumes about petty hopes and 
ambitions?</p>
<p>I do not refer to the wealthy women whose toilets are in 
keeping with their incomes and the general footing of their 
households; that they should spend more or less in fitting 
themselves out daintily is of little importance.&nbsp; The point 
where this subject becomes painful is in families of small means 
where young girls imagine that to be elaborately dressed is the 
first essential of existence, and, in consequence, bend their 
labors and their intelligence towards this end.&nbsp; Last spring
I asked an old friend where she and her daughters intended 
passing their summer.&nbsp; Her answer struck me as being 
characteristic enough to quote: &ldquo;We should much 
prefer,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;returning to Bar Harbor, for we 
all enjoy that place and have many friends there.&nbsp; But the 
truth is, my daughters have bought themselves very little in the 
way of toilet this year, as our finances are not in a flourishing
condition.&nbsp; So my poor girls will be obliged to make their 
last year&rsquo;s dresses do for another season.&nbsp; Under 
these circumstances, it is out of the question for us to return a
second summer to the same place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I do not know how this anecdote strikes my readers.&nbsp; It 
made me thoughtful and sad to think that, in a family of 
intelligent and practical women, such a reason should be 
considered sufficient to outweigh enjoyment, social relations, 
even health, and allowed to change the plans of an entire 
family.</p>
<p>As American women are so fond of copying English ways they 
should be willing to take a few lessons on the subject of raiment
from across the water.&nbsp; As this is not intended to be a 
dissertation on &ldquo;How to Dress Well on Nothing a 
Year,&rdquo; and as I feel the greatest diffidence in approaching
a subject of which I know absolutely nothing, it will be better 
to sheer off from these reefs and quicksands.&nbsp; Every one who
reads these lines will know perfectly well what is meant, when 
reference is made to the good sense and practical utility of 
English women&rsquo;s dress.</p>
<p>What disgusts and angers me (when my way takes me into our 
surface or elevated cars or into ferry boats and local trains) is
the utter dissonance between the outfit of most of the women I 
meet and their position and occupation.&nbsp; So universal is 
this, that it might almost be laid down as an axiom, that the 
American woman, no matter in what walk of life you observe her, 
or what the time or the place, is always persistently and 
grotesquely overdressed.&nbsp; From the women who frequent the 
hotels of our summer or winter resorts, down all the steps of the
social staircase to the char-woman, who consents (spasmodically) 
to remove the dust and waste-papers from my office, there seems 
to be the same complete disregard of fitness.&nbsp; The other 
evening, in leaving my rooms, I brushed against a portly person 
in the half-light of the corridor.&nbsp; There was a shimmer of 
(what appeared to my inexperienced eyes as) costly stuffs, a huge
hat crowned the shadow itself, &ldquo;topped by nodding 
plumes,&rdquo; which seemed to account for the depleted condition
of my feather duster.</p>
<p>I found on inquiring of the janitor, that the dressy person I 
had met, was the char-woman in street attire, and that a closet 
was set aside in the building, for the special purpose of her 
morning and evening transformations, which she underwent in the 
belief that her social position in Avenue A would suffer, should 
she appear in the streets wearing anything less costly than 
seal-skin and velvet or such imitations of those expensive 
materials as her stipend would permit.</p>
<p>I have as tenants of a small wooden house in Jersey City, a 
bank clerk, his wife and their three daughters.&nbsp; He earns in
the neighborhood of fifteen hundred dollars a year.&nbsp; Their 
rent (with which, by the way, they are always in arrears) is 
three hundred dollars.&nbsp; I am favored spring and autumn by a 
visit from the ladies of that family, in the hope (generally 
futile) of inducing me to do some ornamental papering or painting
in their residence, subjects on which they have by experience 
found my agent to be unapproachable.&nbsp; When those four women 
descend upon me, I am fairly dazzled by the splendor of their 
attire, and lost in wonder as to how the price of all that finery
can have been squeezed out of the twelve remaining hundreds of 
their income.&nbsp; When I meet the father he is shabby to the 
outer limits of the genteel.&nbsp; His hat has, I am sure, 
supported the suns and snowstorms of a dozen seasons.&nbsp; There
is a threadbare shine on his apparel that suggests a heartache in
each whitened seam, but the ladies are mirrors of fashion, as 
well as moulds of form.&nbsp; What can remain for any creature 
comforts after all those fine clothes have been paid for?&nbsp; 
And how much is put away for the years when the long-suffering 
money maker will be past work, or saved towards the time when 
sickness or accident shall appear on the horizon?&nbsp; How those
ladies had the &ldquo;nerve&rdquo; to enter a ferry boat or crowd
into a cable car, dressed as they were, has always been a marvel 
to me.&nbsp; A landau and two liveried servants would barely have
been in keeping with their appearance.</p>
<p>Not long ago, a great English nobleman, who is also famous in 
the yachting world, visited this country accompanied by his two 
daughters, high-bred and genial ladies.&nbsp; No self-respecting 
American shop girl or fashionable typewriter would have 
condescended to appear in the inexpensive attire which those 
English women wore.&nbsp; Wherever one met them, at dinner, 
<i>f&ecirc;te</i>, or ball, they were always the most simply 
dressed women in the room.&nbsp; I wonder if it ever occurred to 
any of their gorgeously attired hostesses, that it was because 
their transatlantic guests were so sure of their position, that 
they contented themselves with such simple toilets knowing that 
nothing they might wear could either improve or alter their 
standing.</p>
<p>In former ages, sumptuary laws were enacted by parental 
governments, in the hope of suppressing extravagance in dress, 
the state of affairs we deplore now, not being a new development 
of human weakness, but as old as wealth.</p>
<p>The desire to shine by the splendor of one&rsquo;s trappings 
is the first idea of the parvenu, especially here in this 
country, where the ambitious are denied the pleasure of acquiring
a title, and where official rank carries with it so little social
weight.&nbsp; Few more striking ways present themselves to the 
crude and half-educated for the expenditure of a new fortune than
the purchase of sumptuous apparel, the satisfaction being 
immediate and material.&nbsp; The wearer of a complete and 
perfect toilet must experience a delight of which the uninitiated
know nothing, for such cruel sacrifices are made and so many 
privations endured to procure this satisfaction.&nbsp; When I see
groups of women, clad in the latest designs of purple and fine 
linen, stand shivering on street corners of a winter night, until
they can crowd into a car, I doubt if the joy they get from their
clothes, compensates them for the creature comforts they are 
forced to forego, and I wonder if it never occurs to them to 
spend less on their wardrobes and so feel they can afford to 
return from a theatre or concert comfortably, in a cab, as a 
foreign woman, with their income would do.</p>
<p>There is a stoical determination about the American point of 
view that compels a certain amount of respect.&nbsp; Our 
countrywomen will deny themselves pleasures, will economize on 
their food and will remain in town during the summer, but when 
walking abroad they must be clad in the best, so that no one may 
know by their appearance if the income be counted by hundreds or 
thousands.</p>
<p>While these standards prevail and the female mind is fixed on 
this subject with such dire intent, it is not astonishing that a 
weaker sister is occasionally tempted beyond her powers of 
resistance.&nbsp; Nor that each day a new case of a well-dressed 
woman thieving in a shop reaches our ears.&nbsp; The poor 
feeble-minded creature is not to blame.&nbsp; She is but the 
reflexion of the minds around her and is probably like the lady 
Emerson tells of, who confessed to him &ldquo;that the sense of 
being perfectly well-dressed had given her a feeling of inward 
tranquillity which religion was powerless to bestow.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>No. 5&mdash;On Some Gilded Misalliances</h2>
<p>A dear old American lady, who lived the greater part of her 
life in Rome, and received every body worth knowing in her 
spacious drawing-rooms, far up in the dim vastnesses of a Roman 
palace, used to say that she had only known one really happy 
marriage made by an American girl abroad.</p>
<p>In those days, being young and innocent, I considered that 
remark cynical, and in my heart thought nothing could be more 
romantic and charming than for a fair compatriot to assume an 
historic title and retire to her husband&rsquo;s estates, and 
rule smilingly over him and a devoted tenantry, as in the last 
act of a comic opera, when a rose-colored light is burning and 
the orchestra plays the last brilliant chords of a wedding 
march.</p>
<p>There seemed to my perverted sense a certain poetic justice 
about the fact that money, gained honestly but prosaically, in 
groceries or gas, should go to regild an ancient blazon or prop 
up the crumbling walls of some stately palace abroad.</p>
<p>Many thoughtful years and many cruel realities have taught me 
that my gracious hostess of the &ldquo;seventies&rdquo; was 
right, and that marriage under these conditions is apt to be much
more like the comic opera after the curtain has been rung down, 
when the lights are out, the applauding public gone home, and the
weary actors brought slowly back to the present and the positive,
are wondering how they are to pay their rent or dodge the warrant
in ambush around the corner.</p>
<p>International marriages usually come about from a deficient 
knowledge of the world.&nbsp; The father becomes rich, the family
travel abroad, some mutual friend (often from purely interested 
motives) produces a suitor for the hand of the daughter, in the 
shape of a &ldquo;prince&rdquo; with a title that makes the whole
simple American family quiver with delight.</p>
<p>After a few visits the suitor declares himself; the girl is 
flattered, the father loses his head, seeing visions of his loved
daughter hob-nobbing with royalty, and (intoxicating thought!) 
snubbing the &ldquo;swells&rdquo; at home who had shown 
reluctance to recognize him and his family.</p>
<p>It is next to impossible for him to get any reliable 
information about his future son-in-law in a country where, as an
American, he has few social relations, belongs to no club, and 
whose idiom is a sealed book to him.&nbsp; Every circumstance 
conspires to keep the flaws on the article for sale out of sight 
and place the suitor in an advantageous light.&nbsp; Several 
weeks&rsquo; &ldquo;courting&rdquo; follows, paterfamilias agrees
to part with a handsome share of his earnings, and a marriage is 
&ldquo;arranged.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the case where the girl has retained some of her 
self-respect the suitor is made to come to her country for the 
ceremony.&nbsp; And, that the contrast between European ways and 
our simple habits may not be too striking, an establishment is 
hastily got together, with hired liveries and new-bought 
carriages, as in a recent case in this state.&nbsp; The 
sensational papers write up this &ldquo;international 
union,&rdquo; and publish &ldquo;faked&rdquo; portraits of the 
bride and her noble spouse.&nbsp; The sovereign of the 
groom&rsquo;s country (enchanted that some more American money is
to be imported into his land) sends an economical present and an 
autograph letter.&nbsp; The act ends.&nbsp; Limelight and slow 
music!</p>
<p>In a few years rumors of dissent and trouble float vaguely 
back to the girl&rsquo;s family.&nbsp; Finally, either a great 
scandal occurs, and there is one dishonored home the more in the 
world, or an expatriated woman, thousands of miles from the 
friends and relatives who might be of some comfort to her, makes 
up her mind to accept &ldquo;anything&rdquo; for the sake of her 
children, and attempts to build up some sort of an existence out 
of the remains of her lost illusions, and the father wakes up 
from his dream to realize that his wealth has only served to ruin
what he loved best in all the world.</p>
<p>Sometimes the conditions are delightfully comic, as in a 
well-known case, where the daughter, who married into an 
indolent, happy-go-lucky Italian family, had inherited her 
father&rsquo;s business push and energy along with his fortune, 
and immediately set about &ldquo;running&rdquo; her 
husband&rsquo;s estate as she had seen her father do his 
bank.&nbsp; She tried to revive a half-forgotten industry in the 
district, scraped and whitewashed their picturesque old villa, 
proposed her husband&rsquo;s entering business, and in short 
dashed head down against all his inherited traditions and 
national prejudices, until her new family loathed the sight of 
the brisk American face, and the poor she had tried to help, 
sulked in their newly drained houses and refused to be 
comforted.&nbsp; Her ways were not Italian ways, and she seemed 
to the nun-like Italian ladies, almost unsexed, as she tramped 
about the fields, talking artificial manure and subsoil drainage 
with the men.&nbsp; Yet neither she nor her husband was to 
blame.&nbsp; The young Italian had but followed the teachings of 
his family, which decreed that the only honorable way for an 
aristocrat to acquire wealth was to marry it.&nbsp; The American 
wife honestly tried to do her duty in this new position, 
na&iuml;vely thinking she could engraft transatlantic 
&ldquo;go&rdquo; upon the indolent Italian character.&nbsp; Her 
work was in vain; she made herself and her husband so unpopular 
that they are now living in this country, regretting too late the
error of their ways.</p>
<p>Another case but little less laughable, is that of a Boston 
girl with a neat little fortune of her own, who, when married to 
the young Viennese of her choice, found that he expected her to 
live with his family on the third floor of their 
&ldquo;palace&rdquo; (the two lower floors being rented to 
foreigners), and as there was hardly enough money for a box at 
the opera, she was not expected to go, whereas his position made 
it necessary for him to have a stall and appear there nightly 
among the men of his rank, the astonished and disillusioned 
Bostonian remaining at home <i>en 
t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i> with the women of his family, 
who seemed to think this the most natural arrangement in the 
world.</p>
<p>It certainly is astonishing that we, the most patriotic of 
nations, with such high opinion of ourselves and our 
institutions, should be so ready to hand over our daughters and 
our ducats to the first foreigner who asks for them, often 
requiring less information about him than we should consider 
necessary before buying a horse or a dog.</p>
<p>Women of no other nation have this mania for espousing 
aliens.&nbsp; Nowhere else would a girl with a large fortune 
dream of marrying out of her country.&nbsp; Her highest ideal of 
a husband would be a man of her own kin.&nbsp; It is the rarest 
thing in the world to find a well-born French, Spanish, or 
Italian woman married to a foreigner and living away from her 
country.&nbsp; How can a woman expect to be happy separated from 
all the ties and traditions of her youth?&nbsp; If she is taken 
abroad young, she may still hope to replace her friends as is 
often done.&nbsp; But the real reason of unhappiness (greater and
deeper than this) lies in the fundamental difference of the whole
social structure between our country and that of her adoption, 
and the radically different way of looking at every side of 
life.</p>
<p>Surely a girl must feel that a man who allows a marriage to be
arranged for him (and only signs the contact because its 
pecuniary clauses are to his satisfaction, and who would withdraw
in a moment if these were suppressed), must have an entirely 
different point of view from her own on all the vital issues of 
life.</p>
<p>Foreigners undoubtedly make excellent husbands for their own 
women.&nbsp; But they are, except in rare cases, unsatisfactory 
helpmeets for American girls.&nbsp; It is impossible to touch on 
more than a side or two of this subject.&nbsp; But as an 
illustration the following contrasted stories may be cited:</p>
<p>Two sisters of an aristocratic American family, each with an 
income of over forty thousand dollars a year, recently married 
French noblemen.&nbsp; They naturally expected to continue abroad
the life they had led at home, in which opera boxes, saddle 
horses, and constant entertaining were matters of course.&nbsp; 
In both cases, our compatriots discovered that their husbands 
(neither of them penniless) had entirely different views.&nbsp; 
In the first place, they were told that it was considered 
&ldquo;bad form&rdquo; in France for young married women to 
entertain; besides, the money was needed for improvements, and in
many other ways, and as every well-to-do French family puts aside
at least a third of its income as <i>dots</i> for the children 
(boys as well as girls), these brides found themselves cramped 
for money for the first time in their lives, and obliged, during 
their one month a year in Paris, to put up with hired traps, and 
depend on their friends for evenings at the opera.</p>
<p>This story is a telling set-off to the case of an American 
wife, who one day received a windfall in the form of a check for 
a tidy amount.&nbsp; She immediately proposed a trip abroad to 
her husband, but found that he preferred to remain at home in the
society of his horses and dogs.&nbsp; So our fair compatriot 
starts off (with his full consent), has her outing, spends her 
little &ldquo;pile,&rdquo; and returns after three or four months
to the home of her delighted spouse.</p>
<p>Do these two stories need any comment?&nbsp; Let our sisters 
and their friends think twice before they make themselves 
irrevocably wheels in a machine whose working is unknown to them,
lest they be torn to pieces as it moves.&nbsp; Having the good 
luck to be born in the &ldquo;paradise of women,&rdquo; let them 
beware how they leave it, charm the serpent never so wisely, for 
they may find themselves, like the Peri, outside the gate.</p>
<h2>No. 6&mdash;The Complacency of Mediocrity</h2>
<p>Full as small intellects are of queer kinks, unexplained 
turnings and groundless likes and dislikes, the bland contentment
that buoys up the incompetent is the most difficult of all 
vagaries to account for.&nbsp; Rarely do twenty-four hours pass 
without examples of this exasperating weakness appearing on the 
surface of those shallows that commonplace people so na&iuml;vely
call &ldquo;their minds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What one would expect is extreme modesty, in the half-educated
or the ignorant, and self-approbation higher up in the scale, 
where it might more reasonably dwell.&nbsp; Experience, however, 
teaches that exactly the opposite is the case among those who 
have achieved success.</p>
<p>The accidents of a life turned by chance out of the beaten 
tracks, have thrown me at times into acquaintanceship with some 
of the greater lights of the last thirty years.&nbsp; And not 
only have they been, as a rule, most unassuming men and women; 
but in the majority of cases positively self-depreciatory; 
doubting of themselves and their talents, constantly aiming at 
greater perfection in their art or a higher development of their 
powers, never contented with what they have achieved, beyond the 
idea that it has been another step toward their goal.&nbsp; 
Knowing this, it is always a shock on meeting the mediocre people
who form such a discouraging majority in any society, to discover
that they are all so pleased with themselves, their achievements,
their place in the world, and their own ability and 
discernment!</p>
<p>Who has not sat chafing in silence while Mediocrity, in a 
white waistcoat and jangling fobs, occupied the after-dinner hour
in imparting second-hand information as his personal views on 
literature and art?&nbsp; Can you not hear him saying once again:
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t pretend to know anything about art and all 
that sort of thing, you know, but when I go to an exhibition I 
can always pick out the best pictures at a glance.&nbsp; Sort of 
a way I have, and I never make mistakes, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then go and watch, as I have, Henri Rochefort as he 
laboriously forms the opinions that are to appear later in one of
his &ldquo;<i>Salons</i>,&rdquo; realizing the while that he is 
<i>facile princeps</i> among the art critics of his day, that 
with a line he can make or mar a reputation and by a word draw 
the admiring crowd around an unknown canvas.&nbsp; While 
Rochefort toils and ponders and hesitates, do you suppose a doubt
as to his own astuteness ever dims the self-complacency of White 
Waistcoat?&nbsp; Never!</p>
<p>There lies the strength of the feeble-minded.&nbsp; By a 
special dispensation of Providence, they can never see but one 
side of a subject, so are always convinced that they are right, 
and from the height of their contentment, look down on those who 
chance to differ with them.</p>
<p>A lady who has gathered into her dainty salons the fruit of 
many years&rsquo; careful study and tireless 
&ldquo;weeding&rdquo; will ask anxiously if you are quite sure 
you like the effect of her latest acquisition&mdash;some 
eighteenth-century statuette or screen (flotsam, probably, from 
the great shipwreck of Versailles), and listen earnestly to your 
verdict.&nbsp; The good soul who has just furnished her house by 
contract, with the latest &ldquo;Louis Fourteenth Street&rdquo; 
productions, conducts you complacently through her chambers of 
horrors, wreathed in tranquil smiles, born of ignorance and that 
smug assurance granted only to the&mdash;small.</p>
<p>When a small intellect goes in for cultivating itself and 
improving its mind, you realize what the poet meant in asserting 
that a little learning was a dangerous thing.&nbsp; For 
Mediocrity is apt, when it dines out, to get up a subject 
beforehand, and announce to an astonished circle, as quite new 
and personal discoveries, that the Renaissance was introduced 
into France from Italy, or that Columbus in his day made 
important &ldquo;finds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the incompetent advance another step and write or 
paint&mdash;which, alas! is only too frequent&mdash;the world of 
art and literature is flooded with their productions.&nbsp; When 
White Waistcoat, for example, takes to painting, late in life, 
and comes to you, canvas in hand, for criticism (read praise), he
is apt to remark modestly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Corot never painted until he was fifty, and I am only 
forty-eight.&nbsp; So I feel I should not let myself be 
discouraged.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The problem of life is said to be the finding of a happiness 
that is not enjoyed at the expense of others, and surely this 
class have solved that Sphinx&rsquo;s riddle, for they float 
through their days in a dream of complacency disturbed neither by
corroding doubt nor harassed by jealousies.</p>
<p>Whole families of feeble-minded people, on the strength of an 
ancestor who achieved distinction a hundred years ago, live in 
constant thanksgiving that they &ldquo;are not as other 
men.&rdquo;&nbsp; None of the great man&rsquo;s descendants have 
done anything to be particularly proud of since their remote 
progenitor signed the Declaration of Independence or governed a 
colony.&nbsp; They have vegetated in small provincial cities and 
inter-married into other equally fortunate families, but the 
sense of superiority is ever present to sustain them, under 
straitened circumstances and diminishing prestige.&nbsp; The 
world may move on around them, but they never advance.&nbsp; Why 
should they?&nbsp; They have reached perfection.&nbsp; The brains
and enterprise that have revolutionized our age knock in vain at 
their doors.&nbsp; They belong to that vast &ldquo;majority that 
is always in the wrong,&rdquo; being so pleased with themselves, 
their ways, and their feeble little lines of thought, that any 
change or advancement gives their system a shock.</p>
<p>A painter I know was once importuned for a sketch by a lady of
this class.&nbsp; After many delays and renewed demands he 
presented her one day, when she and some friends were visiting 
his studio, with a delightful open-air study simply framed.&nbsp;
She seemed confused at the offering, to his astonishment, as she 
had not lacked <i>aplomb</i> in asking for the sketch.&nbsp; 
After much blushing and fumbling she succeeded in getting the 
painting loose, and handing back the frame, remarked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will take the painting, but you must keep the 
frame.&nbsp; My husband would never allow me to accept anything 
of value from you!&rdquo;&mdash;and smiled on the speechless 
painter, doubtless charmed with her own tact.</p>
<p>Complacent people are the same drag on a society that a brake 
would be to a coach going up hill.&nbsp; They are the 
&ldquo;eternal negative&rdquo; and would extinguish, if they 
could, any light stronger than that to which their weak eyes have
been accustomed.&nbsp; They look with astonishment and distrust 
at any one trying to break away from their tiresome old ways and 
habits, and wonder why all the world is not as pleased with their
personalities as they are themselves, suggesting, if you are 
willing to waste your time listening to their twaddle, that there
is something radically wrong in any innovation, that both 
&ldquo;Church and State&rdquo; will be imperilled if things are 
altered.&nbsp; No blight, no mildew is more fatal to a plant than
the &ldquo;complacent&rdquo; are to the world.&nbsp; They resent 
any progress and are offended if you mention before them any new 
standards or points of view.&nbsp; &ldquo;What has been good 
enough for us and our parents should certainly be satisfactory to
the younger generations.&rdquo;&nbsp; It seems to the contented 
like pure presumption on the part of their acquaintances to 
wander after strange gods, in the shape of new ideals, higher 
standards of culture, or a perfected refinement of 
surroundings.</p>
<p>We are perhaps wrong to pity complacent people.&nbsp; It is 
for another class our sympathy should be kept; for those who 
cannot refrain from doubting of themselves and the value of their
work&mdash;those unfortunate gifted and artistic spirits who 
descend too often the <i>via dolorosa</i> of discontent and 
despair, who have a higher ideal than their neighbors, and, in 
struggling after an unattainable perfection, fall by the 
wayside.</p>
<h2>No. 7&mdash;The Discontent of Talent</h2>
<p>The complacency that buoys up self-sufficient souls, soothing 
them with the illusion that they themselves, their towns, 
country, language, and habits are above improvement, causing them
to shudder, as at a sacrilege, if any changes are suggested, is 
fortunately limited to a class of stay-at-home nonentities.&nbsp;
In proportion as it is common among them, is it rare or 
delightfully absent in any society of gifted or imaginative 
people.</p>
<p>Among our globe-trotting compatriots this defect is much less 
general than in the older nations of the world, for the excellent
reason, that the moment a man travels or takes the trouble to 
know people of different nationalities, his armor of complacency 
receives so severe a blow, that it is shattered forever, the 
wanderer returning home wiser and much more modest.&nbsp; There 
seems to be something fatal to conceit in the air of great 
centres; professionally or in general society a man so soon finds
his level.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;great world&rdquo; may foster other faults; human 
nature is sure to develop some in every walk of life.&nbsp; Smug 
contentment, however, disappears in its rarefied atmosphere, 
giving place to a craving for improvement, a nervous alertness 
that keeps the mind from stagnating and urges it on to do its 
best.</p>
<p>It is never the beautiful woman who sits down in smiling 
serenity before her mirror.&nbsp; She is tireless in her efforts 
to enhance her beauty and set it off to the best advantage.&nbsp;
Her figure is never slender enough, nor her carriage sufficiently
erect to satisfy.&nbsp; But the &ldquo;frump&rdquo; will let 
herself and all her surroundings go to seed, not from humbleness 
of mind or an overwhelming sense of her own unworthiness, but in 
pure complacent conceit.</p>
<p>A criticism to which the highly gifted lay themselves open 
from those who do not understand them, is their love of praise, 
the critics failing to grasp the fact that this passion for 
measuring one&rsquo;s self with others, like the gad-fly pursuing
poor Io, never allows a moment&rsquo;s repose in the green 
pastures of success, but goads them constantly up the rocky sides
of endeavor.&nbsp; It is not that they love flattery, but that 
they need approbation as a counterpoise to the dark moments of 
self-abasement and as a sustaining aid for higher flights.</p>
<p>Many years ago I was present at a final sitting which my 
master, Carolus Duran, gave to one of my fair compatriots.&nbsp; 
He knew that the lady was leaving Paris on the morrow, and that 
in an hour, her husband and his friends were coming to see and 
criticise the portrait&mdash;always a terrible ordeal for an 
artist.</p>
<p>To any one familiar with this painter&rsquo;s moods, it was 
evident that the result of the sitting was not entirely 
satisfactory.&nbsp; The quick breathing, the impatient tapping 
movement of the foot, the swift backward springs to obtain a 
better view, so characteristic of him in moments of doubt, and 
which had twenty years before earned him the name of <i>le 
danseur</i> from his fellow-copyists at the Louvre, betrayed to 
even a casual observer that his discouragement and discontent 
were at boiling point.</p>
<p>The sound of a bell and a murmur of voices announced the 
entrance of the visitors into the vast studio.&nbsp; After the 
formalities of introduction had been accomplished the new-comers 
glanced at the portrait, but uttered never a word.&nbsp; From it 
they passed in a perfectly casual manner to an inspection of the 
beautiful contents of the room, investigating the tapestries, 
admiring the armor, and finally, after another glance at the 
portrait, the husband remarked: &ldquo;You have given my wife a 
jolly long neck, haven&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; and, turning to his 
friends, began laughing and chatting in English.</p>
<p>If vitriol had been thrown on my poor master&rsquo;s quivering
frame, the effect could not have been more instantaneous, his 
ignorance of the language spoken doubtless exaggerating his 
impression of being ridiculed.&nbsp; Suddenly he turned very 
white, and before any of us had divined his intention he had 
seized a Japanese sword lying by and cut a dozen gashes across 
the canvas.&nbsp; Then, dropping his weapon, he flung out of the 
room, leaving his sitter and her friends in speechless 
consternation, to wonder then and ever after in what way they had
offended him.&nbsp; In their opinions, if a man had talent and 
understood his business, he should produce portraits with the 
same ease that he would answer dinner invitations, and if they 
paid for, they were in no way bound also to praise, his 
work.&nbsp; They were entirely pleased with the result, but did 
not consider it necessary to tell him so, no idea having crossed 
their minds that he might be in one of those moods so frequent 
with artistic natures, when words of approbation and praise are 
as necessary to them, as the air we breathe is to us, mortals of 
a commoner clay.</p>
<p>Even in the theatrical and operatic professions, those hotbeds
of conceit, you will generally find among the &ldquo;stars&rdquo;
abysmal depths of discouragement and despair.&nbsp; One great 
tenor, who has delighted New York audiences during several 
winters past, invariably announces to his intimates on arising 
that his &ldquo;voice has gone,&rdquo; and that, in consequence 
he will &ldquo;never sing again,&rdquo; and has to be caressed 
and cajoled back into some semblance of confidence before 
attempting a performance.&nbsp; This same artist, with an almost 
limitless repertoire and a reputation no new successes could 
enhance, recently risked all to sing what he considered a higher 
class of music, infinitely more fatiguing to his voice, because 
he was impelled onward by the ideal that forces genius to 
constant improvement and development of its powers.</p>
<p>What the people who meet these artists occasionally at a 
private concert or behind the scenes during the intense strain of
a representation, take too readily for monumental egoism and 
conceit, is, the greater part of the time, merely the desire for 
a sustaining word, a longing for the stimulant of praise.</p>
<p>All actors and singers are but big children, and must be 
humored and petted like children when you wish them to do their 
best.&nbsp; It is necessary for them to feel in touch with their 
audiences; to be assured that they are not falling below the high
ideals formed for their work.</p>
<p>Some winters ago a performance at the opera nearly came to a 
standstill because an all-conquering soprano was found crying in 
her dressing-room.&nbsp; After many weary moments of consolation 
and questioning, it came out that she felt quite sure she no 
longer had any talent.&nbsp; One of the other singers had laughed
at her voice, and in consequence there was nothing left to live 
for.&nbsp; A half-hour later, owing to judicious 
&ldquo;treatment,&rdquo; she was singing gloriously and bowing 
her thanks to thunders of applause.</p>
<p>Rather than blame this divine discontent that has made man 
what he is to-day, let us glorify and envy it, pitying the while 
the frail mortal vessels it consumes with its flame.&nbsp; No 
adulation can turn such natures from their goal, and in the hour 
of triumph the slave is always at their side to whisper the word 
of warning.&nbsp; This discontent is the leaven that has raised 
the whole loaf of dull humanity to better things and higher 
efforts, those privileged to feel it are the suns that illuminate
our system.&nbsp; If on these luminaries observers have 
discovered spots, it is well to remember that these blemishes are
but the defects of their qualities, and better far than the total
eclipse that shrouds so large a part of humanity in colorless 
complacency.</p>
<p>It will never be known how many master-pieces have been lost 
to the world because at the critical moment a friend has not been
at hand with the stimulant of sympathy and encouragement needed 
by an overworked, straining artist who was beginning to lose 
confidence in himself; to soothe his irritated nerves with the 
balm of praise, and take his poor aching head on a friendly 
shoulder and let him sob out there all his doubt and 
discouragement.</p>
<p>So let us not be niggardly or ungenerous in meting out to 
struggling fellow-beings their share, and perchance a little more
than their share of approbation and applause, poor enough return,
after all, for the pleasure their labors have procured us.&nbsp; 
What adequate compensation can we mete out to an author for the 
hours of delight and self-forgetfulness his talent has brought to
us in moments of loneliness, illness, or grief?&nbsp; What can 
pay our debt to a painter who has fixed on canvas the face we 
love?</p>
<p>The little return that it is in our power to make for all the 
joy these gifted fellow-beings bring into our lives is (closing 
our eyes to minor imperfections) to warmly applaud them as they 
move upward, along their stony path.</p>
<h2>No. 8&mdash;Slouch</h2>
<p>I should like to see, in every school-room of our growing 
country, in every business office, at the railway stations, and 
on street corners, large placards placed with &ldquo;Do not 
slouch&rdquo; printed thereon in distinct and imposing 
characters.&nbsp; If ever there was a tendency that needed 
nipping in the bud (I fear the bud is fast becoming a full-blown 
flower), it is this discouraging national failing.</p>
<p>Each year when I return from my spring wanderings, among the 
benighted and effete nations of the Old World, on whom the 
untravelled American looks down from the height of his 
superiority, I am struck anew by the contrast between the trim, 
well-groomed officials left behind on one side of the ocean and 
the happy-go-lucky, slouching individuals I find on the 
other.</p>
<p>As I ride up town this unpleasant impression deepens.&nbsp; In
the &ldquo;little Mother Isle&rdquo; I have just left, 
bus-drivers have quite a coaching air, with hat and coat of 
knowing form.&nbsp; They sport flowers in their button-holes and 
salute other bus-drivers, when they meet, with a twist of whip 
and elbow refreshingly correct, showing that they take pride in 
their calling, and have been at some pains to turn themselves out
as smart in appearance as finances would allow.</p>
<p>Here, on the contrary, the stage and cab drivers I meet seem 
to be under a blight, and to have lost all interest in 
life.&nbsp; They lounge on the box, their legs straggling 
aimlessly, one hand holding the reins, the other hanging 
dejectedly by the side.&nbsp; Yet there is little doubt that 
these heartbroken citizens are earning double what their London 
<i>confr&egrave;res</i> gain.&nbsp; The shadow of the national 
peculiarity is over them.</p>
<p>When I get to my rooms, the elevator boy is reclining in the 
lift, and hardly raises his eye-lids as he languidly manoeuvres 
the rope.&nbsp; I have seen that boy now for months, but never 
when his boots and clothes were brushed or when his cravat was 
not riding proudly above his collar.&nbsp; On occasions I have 
offered him pins, which he took wearily, doubtless because it was
less trouble than to refuse.&nbsp; The next day, however, his 
cravat again rode triumphant, mocking my efforts to keep it in 
its place.&nbsp; His hair, too, has been a cause of wonder to 
me.&nbsp; How does he manage to have it always so long and so 
unkempt?&nbsp; More than once, when expecting callers, I have 
bribed him to have it cut, but it seemed to grow in the night, 
back to its poetic profusion.</p>
<p>In what does this noble disregard for appearances which 
characterizes American men originate?&nbsp; Our climate, as some 
suggest, or discouragement at not all being millionaires?&nbsp; 
It more likely comes from an absence with us of the military 
training that abroad goes so far toward licking young men into 
shape.</p>
<p>I shall never forget the surprise on the face of a French 
statesman to whom I once expressed my sympathy for his country, 
laboring under the burden of so vast a standing army.&nbsp; He 
answered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The financial burden is doubtless great; but you have 
others.&nbsp; Witness your pension expenditures.&nbsp; With us 
the money drawn from the people is used in such a way as to be of
inestimable value to them.&nbsp; We take the young hobbledehoy 
farm-hand or mechanic, ignorant, mannerless, uncleanly as he may 
be, and turn him out at the end of three years with his regiment,
self-respecting and well-mannered, with habits of cleanliness and
obedience, having acquired a bearing, and a love of order that 
will cling to and serve him all his life.&nbsp; We do not go so 
far,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;as our English neighbors in drilling
men into superb manikins of &lsquo;form&rsquo; and 
carriage.&nbsp; Our authorities do not consider it 
necessary.&nbsp; But we reclaim youths from the slovenliness of 
their native village or workshop and make them tidy and mannerly 
citizens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These remarks came to mind the other day as I watched a group 
of New England youths lounging on the steps of the village store,
or sitting in rows on a neighboring fence, until I longed to try 
if even a judicial arrangement of tacks, &lsquo;business-end 
up,&rsquo; on these favorite seats would infuse any energy into 
their movements.&nbsp; I came to the conclusion that my French 
acquaintance was right, for the only trim-looking men to be seen,
were either veterans of our war or youths belonging to the local 
militia.&nbsp; And nowhere does one see finer specimens of 
humanity than West Point and Annapolis turn out.</p>
<p>If any one doubts what kind of men slouching youths develop 
into, let him look when he travels, at the dejected appearance of
the farmhouses throughout our land.&nbsp; Surely our rural 
populations are not so much poorer than those of other 
countries.&nbsp; Yet when one compares the dreary homes of even 
our well-to-do farmers with the smiling, well-kept hamlets seen 
in England or on the Continent, such would seem to be the 
case.</p>
<p>If ours were an old and bankrupt nation, this air of 
discouragement and decay could not be greater.&nbsp; Outside of 
the big cities one looks in vain for some sign of American dash 
and enterprise in the appearance of our men and their homes.</p>
<p>During a journey of over four thousand miles, made last spring
as the guest of a gentleman who knows our country thoroughly, I 
was impressed most painfully with this abject air.&nbsp; Never in
all those days did we see a fruit-tree trained on some sunny 
southern wall, a smiling flower-garden or carefully clipped 
hedge.&nbsp; My host told me that hardly the necessary vegetables
are grown, the inhabitants of the West and South preferring 
canned food.&nbsp; It is less trouble!</p>
<p>If you wish to form an idea of the extent to which slouch 
prevails in our country, try to start a &ldquo;village 
improvement society,&rdquo; and experience, as others have done, 
the apathy and ill-will of the inhabitants when you go about 
among them and strive to summon some of their local pride to your
aid.</p>
<p>In the town near which I pass my summers, a large stone, 
fallen from a passing dray, lay for days in the middle of the 
principal street, until I paid some boys to remove it.&nbsp; No 
one cared, and the dull-eyed inhabitants would doubtless be 
looking at it still but for my impatience.</p>
<p>One would imagine the villagers were all on the point of 
moving away (and they generally are, if they can sell their 
land), so little interest do they show in your plans.&nbsp; Like 
all people who have fallen into bad habits, they have grown to 
love their slatternly ways and cling to them, resenting furiously
any attempt to shake them up to energy and reform.</p>
<p>The farmer has not, however, a monopoly.&nbsp; Slouch seems 
ubiquitous.&nbsp; Our railway and steam-boat systems have tried 
in vain to combat it, and supplied their employees with a livery 
(I beg the free and independent voter&rsquo;s pardon, a 
uniform!), with but little effect.&nbsp; The inherent tendency is
too strong for the corporations.&nbsp; The conductors still 
shuffle along in their spotted garments, the cap on the back of 
the head, and their legs anywhere, while they chew gum in 
defiance of the whole Board of Directors.</p>
<p>Go down to Washington, after a visit to the Houses of 
Parliament or the Chamber of Deputies, and observe the contrast 
between the bearing of our Senators and Representatives and the 
air of their <i>confr&egrave;res</i> abroad.&nbsp; Our law-makers
seem trying to avoid every appearance of 
&ldquo;smartness.&rdquo;&nbsp; Indeed, I am told, so great is the
prejudice in the United States against a well-turned-out man that
a candidate would seriously compromise his chances of election 
who appeared before his constituents in other than the accustomed
shabby frock-coat, unbuttoned and floating, a pot hat, no gloves,
as much doubtfully white shirt-front as possible, and a wisp of 
black silk for a tie; and if he can exhibit also a chin-whisker, 
his chances of election are materially increased.</p>
<p>Nothing offends an eye accustomed to our native <i>laisser 
aller</i> so much as a well-brushed hat and shining boots.&nbsp; 
When abroad, it is easy to spot a compatriot as soon and as far 
as you can see one, by his graceless gait, a cross between a 
lounge and a shuffle.&nbsp; In reading-, or dining-room, he is 
the only man whose spine does not seem equal to its work, so he 
flops and straggles until, for the honor of your land, you long 
to shake him and set him squarely on his legs.</p>
<p>No amount of reasoning can convince me that outward 
slovenliness is not a sign of inward and moral supineness.&nbsp; 
A neglected exterior generally means a lax moral code.&nbsp; The 
man who considers it too much trouble to sit erect can hardly 
have given much time to his tub or his toilet.&nbsp; Having 
neglected his clothes, he will neglect his manners, and between 
morals and manners we know the tie is intimate.</p>
<p>In the Orient a new reign is often inaugurated by the 
construction of a mosque.&nbsp; Vast expense is incurred to make 
it as splendid as possible.&nbsp; But, once completed, it is 
never touched again.&nbsp; Others are built by succeeding 
sovereigns, but neither thought nor treasure is ever expended on 
the old ones.&nbsp; When they can no longer be used, they are 
abandoned, and fall into decay.&nbsp; The same system seems to 
prevail among our private owners and corporations.&nbsp; Streets 
are paved, lamp-posts erected, store-fronts carefully adorned, 
but from the hour the workman puts his finishing touch upon them 
they are abandoned to the hand of fate.&nbsp; The mud may cake up
knee-deep, wind and weather work their own sweet will, it is no 
one&rsquo;s business to interfere.</p>
<p>When abroad one of my amusements has been of an early morning 
to watch Paris making its toilet.&nbsp; The streets are taking a 
bath, liveried attendants are blacking the boots of the 
lamp-posts and newspaper-<i>kiosques</i>, the shop-fronts are 
being shaved and having their hair curled, caf&eacute;&rsquo;s 
and restaurants are putting on clean shirts and tying their 
cravats smartly before their many mirrors.&nbsp; By the time the 
world is up and about, the whole city, smiling freshly from its 
matutinal tub, is ready to greet it gayly.</p>
<p>It is this attention to detail that gives to Continental 
cities their air of cheerfulness and thrift, and the utter lack 
of it that impresses foreigners so painfully on arriving at our 
shores.</p>
<p>It has been the fashion to laugh at the dude and his high 
collar, at the darky in his master&rsquo;s cast-off clothes, 
aping style and fashion.&nbsp; Better the dude, better the 
colored dandy, better even the Bowery &ldquo;tough&rdquo; with 
his affected carriage, for they at least are reaching blindly out
after something better than their surroundings, striving after an
ideal, and are in just so much the superiors of the foolish souls
who mock them&mdash;better, even misguided efforts, than the 
ignoble stagnant quagmire of slouch into which we seem to be 
slowly descending.</p>
<h2>No. 9&mdash;Social Suggestion</h2>
<p>The question of how far we are unconsciously influenced by 
people and surroundings, in our likes and dislikes, our opinions,
and even in our pleasures and intimate tastes, is a delicate and 
interesting one, for the line between success and failure in the 
world, as on the stage or in most of the professions, is so 
narrow and depends so often on what humor one&rsquo;s 
&ldquo;public&rdquo; happen to be in at a particular moment, that
the subject is worthy of consideration.</p>
<p>Has it never happened to you, for instance, to dine with 
friends and go afterwards in a jolly humor to the play which 
proved so delightful that you insist on taking your family 
immediately to see it; when to your astonishment you discover 
that it is neither clever nor amusing, on the contrary rather 
dull.&nbsp; Your family look at you in amazement and wonder what 
you had seen to admire in such an asinine performance.&nbsp; 
There was a case of suggestion!&nbsp; You had been influenced by 
your friends and had shared their opinions.&nbsp; The same thing 
occurs on a higher scale when one is raised out of one&rsquo;s 
self by association with gifted and original people, a communion 
with more cultivated natures which causes you to discover and 
appreciate a thousand hidden beauties in literature, art or music
that left to yourself, you would have failed to notice.&nbsp; 
Under these circumstances you will often be astonished at the 
point and piquancy of your own conversation.&nbsp; This is but 
too true of a number of subjects.</p>
<p>We fondly believe our opinions and convictions to be original,
and with innocent conceit, imagine that we have formed them for 
ourselves.&nbsp; The illusion of being unlike other people is a 
common vanity.&nbsp; Beware of the man who asserts such a 
claim.&nbsp; He is sure to be a bore and will serve up to you, as
his own, a muddle of ideas and opinions which he has absorbed 
like a sponge from his surroundings.</p>
<p>No place is more propitious for studying this curious 
phenomenon, than behind the scenes of a theatre, the last few 
nights before a first performance.&nbsp; The whole company is 
keyed up to a point of mutual admiration that they are far from 
feeling generally.&nbsp; &ldquo;The piece is charming and sure to
be a success.&rdquo;&nbsp; The author and the interpreters of his
thoughts are in complete communion.&nbsp; The first night 
comes.&nbsp; The piece is a failure!&nbsp; Drop into the 
greenroom then and you will find an astonishing change has taken 
place.&nbsp; The Star will take you into a corner and assert 
that, she &ldquo;always knew the thing could not go, it was too 
imbecile, with such a company, it was folly to expect anything 
else.&rdquo;&nbsp; The author will abuse the Star and the 
management.&nbsp; The whole troupe is frankly disconcerted, like 
people aroused out of a hypnotic sleep, wondering what they had 
seen in the play to admire.</p>
<p>In the social world we are even more inconsistent, accepting 
with tameness the most astonishing theories and opinions.&nbsp; 
Whole circles will go on assuring each other how clever Miss 
So-and-So is, or, how beautiful they think someone else.&nbsp; 
Not because these good people are any cleverer, or more 
attractive than their neighbors, but simply because it is in the 
air to have these opinions about them.&nbsp; To such an extent 
does this hold good, that certain persons are privileged to be 
vulgar and rude, to say impertinent things and make remarks that 
would ostracize a less fortunate individual from the polite world
for ever; society will only smilingly shrug its shoulders and 
say: &ldquo;It is only Mr. So-and-So&rsquo;s way.&rdquo;&nbsp; It
is useless to assert that in cases like these, people are in 
possession of their normal senses.&nbsp; They are under 
influences of which they are perfectly unconscious.</p>
<p>Have you ever seen a piece guyed?&nbsp; Few sadder sights 
exist, the human being rarely getting nearer the brute than when 
engaged in this amusement.&nbsp; Nothing the actor or actress can
do will satisfy the public.&nbsp; Men who under ordinary 
circumstances would be incapable of insulting a woman, will 
whistle and stamp and laugh, at an unfortunate girl who is doing 
her utmost to amuse them.&nbsp; A terrible example of this was 
given two winters ago at one of our concert halls, when a family 
of Western singers were subjected to absolute ill-treatment at 
the hands of the public.&nbsp; The young girls were perfectly 
sincere, in their rude way, but this did not prevent men from 
offering them every insult malice could devise, and making them a
target for every missile at hand.&nbsp; So little does the public
think for itself in cases like this, that at the opening of the 
performance had some well-known person given the signal for 
applause, the whole audience would, in all probability, have been
delighted and made the wretched sisters a success.</p>
<p>In my youth it was the fashion to affect admiration for the 
Italian school of painting and especially for the great masters 
of the Renaissance.&nbsp; Whole families of perfectly inartistic 
English and Americans might then he heard conscientiously 
admiring the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel or Leonardo&rsquo;s 
Last Supper (Botticelli had not been invented then) in the 
choicest guide-book language.</p>
<p>When one considers the infinite knowledge of technique 
required to understand the difficulties overcome by the giants of
the Renaissance and to appreciate the intrinsic qualities of 
their creations, one asks one&rsquo;s self in wonder what our 
parents admired in those paintings, and what tempted them to 
bring home and adorn their houses with such dreadful copies of 
their favorites.&nbsp; For if they appreciated the originals they
never would have bought the copies, and if the copies pleased 
them, they must have been incapable of enjoying the 
originals.&nbsp; Yet all these people thought themselves 
perfectly sincere.&nbsp; To-day you will see the same thing going
on before the paintings of Claude Monet and Besnard, the same 
admiration expressed by people who, you feel perfectly sure, do 
not realize why these works of art are superior and can no more 
explain to you why they think as they do than the sheep that 
follow each other through a hole in a wall, can give a reason for
their actions.</p>
<p>Dress and fashion in clothes are subjects above all others, 
where the ineptitude of the human mind is most evident.&nbsp; Can
it be explained in any other way, why the fashions of yesterday 
always appear so hideous to us,&mdash;almost grotesque?&nbsp; 
Take up an old album of photographs and glance over the faded 
contents.&nbsp; Was there ever anything so absurd?&nbsp; Look at 
the top hats men wore, and at the skirts of the women!</p>
<p>The mother of a family said to me the other day: &ldquo;When I
recall the way in which girls were dressed in my youth, I wonder 
how any of us ever got a husband.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Study a photograph of the Empress Eug&eacute;nie, that supreme
arbiter of elegance and grace.&nbsp; Oh! those bunchy hooped 
skirts!&nbsp; That awful India shawl pinned off the shoulders, 
and the bonnet perched on a roll of hair in the nape of the 
neck!&nbsp; What were people thinking of at that time?&nbsp; Were
they lunatics to deform in this way the beautiful lines of the 
human body which it should be the first object of toilet to 
enhance, or were they only lacking in the artistic sense?&nbsp; 
Nothing of the kind.&nbsp; And what is more, they were convinced 
that the real secret of beauty in dress had been discovered by 
them; that past fashions were absurd, and that the future could 
not improve on their creations.&nbsp; The sculptors and painters 
of that day (men of as great talent as any now living), were 
enthusiastic in reproducing those monstrosities in marble or on 
canvas, and authors raved about the ideal grace with which a 
certain beauty draped her shawl.</p>
<p>Another marked manner in which we are influenced by 
circumambient suggestion, is in the transient furore certain 
games and pastimes create.&nbsp; We see intelligent people so 
given over to this influence as barely to allow themselves time 
to eat and sleep, begrudging the hours thus stolen from their 
favorite amusement.</p>
<p>Ten years ago, tennis occupied every moment of our young 
people&rsquo;s time; now golf has transplanted tennis in public 
favor, which does not prove, however, that the latter is the 
better game, but simply that compelled by the accumulated force 
of other people&rsquo;s opinions, youths and maidens, old duffers
and mature spinsters are willing to pass many hours daily in all 
kinds of weather, solemnly following an indian-rubber ball across
ten-acre lots.</p>
<p>If you suggest to people who are laboring under the illusion 
they are amusing themselves that the game, absorbing so much of 
their attention, is not as exciting as tennis nor as clever in 
combinations as croquet, that in fact it would be quite as 
amusing to roll an empty barrel several times around a plowed 
field, they laugh at you in derision and instantly put you down 
in their profound minds as a man who does not understand 
&ldquo;sport.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yet these very people were tennis-mad twenty years ago and had
night come to interrupt a game of croquet would have ordered 
lanterns lighted in order to finish the match so enthralling were
its intricacies.</p>
<p>Everybody has known how to play <i>B&eacute;zique</i> in this 
country for years, yet within the last eighteen months, whole 
circles of our friends have been seized with a midsummer madness 
and willingly sat glued to a card-table through long hot 
afternoons and again after dinner until day dawned on their 
folly.</p>
<p>Certain <i>M&eacute;moires</i> of Louis Fifteenth&rsquo;s 
reign tell of an &ldquo;unravelling&rdquo; mania that developed 
at his court.&nbsp; It began by some people fraying out old silks
to obtain the gold and silver threads from worn-out stuffs; this 
occupation soon became the rage, nothing could restrain the 
delirium of destruction, great ladies tore priceless tapestries 
from their walls and brocades from their furniture, in order to 
unravel those materials and as the old stock did not suffice for 
the demand thousands were spent on new brocades and velvets, 
which were instantly destroyed, entertainments were given where 
unravelling was the only amusement offered, the entire court 
thinking and talking of nothing else for months.</p>
<p>What is the logical deduction to be drawn from all this?&nbsp;
Simply that people do not see with their eyes or judge with their
understandings; that an all-pervading hypnotism, an ambient 
suggestion, at times envelops us taking from people all free 
will, and replacing it with the taste and judgment of the 
moment.</p>
<p>The number of people is small in each generation, who are 
strong enough to rise above their surroundings and think for 
themselves.&nbsp; The rest are as dry leaves on a stream.&nbsp; 
They float along and turn gayly in the eddies, convinced all the 
time (as perhaps are the leaves) that they act entirely from 
their own volition and that their movements are having a profound
influence on the direction and force of the current.</p>
<h2>No. 10&mdash;Bohemia</h2>
<p>Lunching with a talented English comedian and his wife the 
other day, the conversation turned on Bohemia, the evasive 
no-man&rsquo;s-land that Thackeray referred to, in so many of his
books, and to which he looked back lovingly in his later years, 
when, as he said, he had forgotten the road to Prague.</p>
<p>The lady remarked: &ldquo;People have been more than kind to 
us here in New York.&nbsp; We have dined and supped out 
constantly, and have met with gracious kindness, such as we can 
never forget.&nbsp; But so far we have not met a single painter, 
or author, or sculptor, or a man who has explored a corner of the
earth.&nbsp; Neither have we had the good luck to find ourselves 
in the same room with Tesla or Rehan, Edison or Drew.&nbsp; We 
shall regret so much when back in England and are asked about 
your people of talent, being obliged to say, &lsquo;We never met 
any of them.&rsquo;&nbsp; Why is it?&nbsp; We have not been in 
any one circle, and have pitched our tents in many cities, during
our tours over here, but always with the same result.&nbsp; We 
read your American authors as much as, if not more than, our 
own.&nbsp; The names of dozens of your discoverers and painters 
are household words in England.&nbsp; When my husband planned his
first tour over here my one idea was, &lsquo;How nice it will 
be!&nbsp; Now I shall meet those delightful people of whom I have
heard so much.&rsquo;&nbsp; The disappointment has been 
complete.&nbsp; Never one have I seen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I could not but feel how all too true were the remarks of this
intelligent visitor, remembering how quick the society of London 
is to welcome a new celebrity or original character, how a place 
is at once made for him at every hospitable board, a permanent 
one to which he is expected to return; and how no Continental 
entertainment is considered complete without some bright 
particular star to shine in the firmament.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lion-hunting,&rdquo; I hear my reader say with a 
sneer.&nbsp; That may be, but it makes society worth the candle, 
which it rarely is over here.&nbsp; I realized what I had often 
vaguely felt before, that the Bohemia the English lady was 
looking for was not to be found in this country, more&rsquo;s the
pity.&nbsp; Not that the elements are lacking.&nbsp; Far from it,
(for even more than in London should we be able to combine such a
society), but perhaps from a misconception of the true idea of 
such a society, due probably to Henry Murger&rsquo;s dreary book 
<i>Sc&egrave;nes de la vie de Boh&ecirc;me</i> which is 
chargeable with the fact that a circle of this kind evokes in the
mind of most Americans visions of a scrubby, poorly-fed and 
less-washed community, a world they would hardly dare ask to 
their tables for fear of some embarrassing unconventionality of 
conduct or dress.</p>
<p>Yet that can hardly be the reason, for even in Murger or Paul 
de Kock, at their worst, the hero is still a gentleman, and even 
when he borrows a friend&rsquo;s coat, it is to go to a great 
house and among people of rank.&nbsp; Besides, we are becoming 
too cosmopolitan, and wander too constantly over this little 
globe, not to have learned that the Bohemia of 1830 is as 
completely a thing of the past as a <i>grisette</i> or a 
glyphisodon.&nbsp; It disappeared with Gavarni and the authors 
who described it.&nbsp; Although we have kept the word, its 
meaning has gradually changed until it has come to mean something
difficult to define, a will-o&rsquo;-the-wisp, which one tries 
vainly to grasp.&nbsp; With each decade it has put on a new form 
and changed its centre, the one definite fact being that it 
combines the better elements of several social layers.</p>
<p>Drop in, if you are in Paris and know the way, at one of 
Madeleine Lemaire&rsquo;s informal evenings in her studio.&nbsp; 
There you may find the Prince de Ligne, chatting with 
R&eacute;jane or Coquelin; or Henri d&rsquo;Orl&eacute;ans, just 
back from an expedition into Africa.&nbsp; A little further on, 
Saint-Saens will be running over the keys, preparing an 
accompaniment for one of Madame de Tr&eacute;dern&rsquo;s 
songs.&nbsp; The Princess Mathilde (that passionate lover of art)
will surely be there, and&mdash;but it is needless to 
particularize.</p>
<p>Cross the Channel, and get yourself asked to one of 
Irving&rsquo;s choice suppers after the play.&nbsp; You will find
the bar, the stage, and the pulpit represented there, a 
&ldquo;happy family&rdquo; over which the &ldquo;Prince&rdquo; 
often presides, smoking cigar after cigar, until the tardy London
daylight appears to break up the entertainment.</p>
<p>For both are centres where the gifted and the travelled meet 
the great of the social world, on a footing of perfect equality, 
and where, if any prestige is accorded, it is that of 
brains.&nbsp; When you have seen these places and a dozen others 
like them, you will realize what the actor&rsquo;s wife had in 
her mind.</p>
<p>Now, let me whisper to you why I think such circles do not 
exist in this country.&nbsp; In the first place, we are still too
provincial in this big city of ours.&nbsp; New York always 
reminds me of a definition I once heard of California fruit: 
&ldquo;Very large, with no particular flavor.&rdquo;&nbsp; We are
like a boy, who has had the misfortune to grow too quickly and 
look like a man, but whose mind has not kept pace with his 
body.&nbsp; What he knows is undigested and chaotic, while his 
appearance makes you expect more of him than he can 
give&mdash;hence disappointment.</p>
<p>Our society is yet in knickerbockers, and has retained all 
sorts of littlenesses and prejudices which older civilizations 
have long since relegated to the mental lumber room.&nbsp; An 
equivalent to this point of view you will find in England or 
France only in the smaller &ldquo;cathedral&rdquo; cities, and 
even there the old aristocrats have the courage of their 
opinions.&nbsp; Here, where everything is quite frankly on a 
money basis, and &ldquo;positions&rdquo; are made and lost like a
fortune, by a turn of the market, those qualities which are 
purely mental, and on which it is hard to put a practical value, 
are naturally at a discount.&nbsp; We are quite ready to pay for 
the best.&nbsp; Witness our private galleries and the opera, but 
we say, like the parvenu in &Eacute;mile Augier&rsquo;s 
delightful comedy <i>Le Gendre de M. Poirier</i>, 
&ldquo;Patronize art?&nbsp; Of course!&nbsp; But the 
artists?&nbsp; Never!&rdquo;&nbsp; And frankly, it would be too 
much, would it not, to expect a family only half a generation 
away from an iron foundry, or a mine, to be willing to receive 
Irving or Bernhardt on terms of perfect equality?</p>
<p>As it would be unjust to demand a mature mind in the overgrown
boy, it is useless to hope for delicate tact and social feeling 
from the parvenu.&nbsp; To be gracious and at ease with all 
classes and professions, one must be perfectly sure of 
one&rsquo;s own position, and with us few feel this security, it 
being based on too frail a foundation, a crisis in the 
&ldquo;street&rdquo; going a long way towards destroying it.</p>
<p>Of course I am generalizing and doubt not that in many 
cultivated homes the right spirit exists, but unfortunately these
are not the centres which give the tone to our 
&ldquo;world.&rdquo;&nbsp; Lately at one of the most splendid 
houses in this city a young Italian tenor had been engaged to 
sing.&nbsp; When he had finished he stood alone, unnoticed, 
unspoken to for the rest of the evening.&nbsp; He had been paid 
to sing.&nbsp; &ldquo;What more, in common sense, could he 
want?&rdquo; thought the &ldquo;world,&rdquo; without reflecting 
that it was probably not the <i>tenor</i> who lost by that 
arrangement.&nbsp; It needs a delicate hand to hold the reins 
over the backs of such a fine-mouthed community as artists and 
singers form.&nbsp; They rarely give their best when singing or 
performing in a hostile atmosphere.</p>
<p>A few years ago when a fancy-dress ball was given at the 
Academy of Design, the original idea was to have it an 
artists&rsquo; ball; the community of the brush were, however, 
approached with such a complete lack of tact that, with hardly an
exception, they held aloof, and at the ball shone conspicuous by 
their absence.</p>
<p>At present in this city I know of but two hospitable firesides
where you are sure to meet the best the city holds of either 
foreign or native talent.&nbsp; The one is presided over by the 
wife of a young composer, and the other, oddly enough, by two 
unmarried ladies.&nbsp; An invitation to a dinner or a supper at 
either of these houses is as eagerly sought after and as highly 
prized in the great world as it is by the Bohemians, though 
neither &ldquo;salon&rdquo; is open regularly.</p>
<p>There is still hope for us, and I already see signs of better 
things.&nbsp; Perhaps, when my English friend returns in a few 
years, we may be able to prove to her that we have found the road
to Prague.</p>
<h2>No. 11&mdash;Social Exiles</h2>
<p>Balzac, in his <i>Com&eacute;die Humaine</i>, has reviewed 
with a master-hand almost every phase of the Social World of 
Paris down to 1850 and Thackeray left hardly a corner of London 
High Life unexplored; but so great have been the changes 
(progress, its admirers call it,) since then, that, could Balzac 
come back to his beloved Paris, he would feel like a foreigner 
there; and Thackeray, who was among us but yesterday, would have 
difficulty in finding his bearings in the sea of the London world
to-day.</p>
<p>We have changed so radically that even a casual observer 
cannot help being struck by the difference.&nbsp; Among other 
most significant &ldquo;phenomena&rdquo; has appeared a phase of 
life that not only neither of these great men observed (for the 
very good reason that it had not appeared in their time), but 
which seems also to have escaped the notice of the writers of our
own day, close observers as they are of any new 
development.&nbsp; I mean the class of Social Exiles, pitiable 
wanderers from home and country, who haunt the Continent, and are
to be found (sad little colonies) in out-of-the-way corners of 
almost every civilized country.</p>
<p>To know much of this form of modern life, one must have been a
wanderer, like myself, and have pitched his tent in many queer 
places; for they are shy game and not easily raised, frequenting 
mostly quiet old cities like Versailles and Florence, or 
inexpensive watering-places where their meagre incomes become 
affluence by contrast.&nbsp; The first thought on dropping in on 
such a settlement is, &ldquo;How in the world did these people 
ever drift here?&rdquo;&nbsp; It is simple enough and generally 
comes about in this way:</p>
<p>The father of a wealthy family dies.&nbsp; The fortune turns 
out to be less than was expected.&nbsp; The widow and children 
decide to go abroad for a year or so, during their period of 
mourning, partially for distraction, and partially (a fact which 
is not spoken of) because at home they would be forced to change 
their way of living to a simpler one, and that is hard to do, 
just at first.&nbsp; Later they think it will be quite 
easy.&nbsp; So the family emigrates, and after a little 
sight-seeing, settles in Dresden or Tours, casually at first, in 
a hotel.&nbsp; If there are young children they are made the 
excuse.&nbsp; &ldquo;The languages are so important!&rdquo;&nbsp;
Or else one of the daughters develops a taste for music, or a son
takes up the study of art.&nbsp; In a year or two, before a 
furnished apartment is taken, the idea of returning is discussed,
but abandoned &ldquo;for the present.&rdquo;&nbsp; They begin 
vaguely to realize how difficult it will be to take life up again
at home.&nbsp; During all this time their income (like everything
else when the owners are absent) has been slowly but surely 
disappearing, making the return each year more difficult.&nbsp; 
Finally, for economy, an unfurnished apartment is taken.&nbsp; 
They send home for bits of furniture and family belongings, and 
gradually drop into the great army of the expatriated.</p>
<p>Oh, the pathos of it!&nbsp; One who has not seen these poor 
stranded waifs in their self-imposed exile, with eyes turned 
towards their native land, cannot realize all the sadness and 
loneliness they endure, rarely adopting the country of their 
residence but becoming more firmly American as the years go 
by.&nbsp; The home papers and periodicals are taken, the American
church attended, if there happens to be one; the English chapel, 
if there is not.&nbsp; Never a French church!&nbsp; In their 
hearts they think it almost irreverent to read the service in 
French.&nbsp; The acquaintance of a few fellow-exiles is made and
that of a half-dozen English families, mothers and daughters and 
a younger son or two, whom the ferocious primogeniture custom has
cast out of the homes of their childhood to economize on the 
Continent.</p>
<p>I have in my mind a little settlement of this kind at 
Versailles, which was a type.&nbsp; The formal old city, fallen 
from its grandeur, was a singularly appropriate setting to the 
little comedy.&nbsp; There the modest purses of the exiles found 
rents within their reach, the quarters vast and airy.&nbsp; The 
galleries and the park afforded a diversion, and then Paris, dear
Paris, the American Mecca, was within reach.&nbsp; At the time I 
knew it, the colony was fairly prosperous, many of its members 
living in the two or three principal <i>pensions</i>, the others 
in apartments of their own.&nbsp; They gave feeble little 
entertainments among themselves, card-parties and teas, and dined
about with each other at their respective <i>tables 
d&rsquo;h&ocirc;te</i>, even knowing a stray Frenchman or two, 
whom the quest of a meal had tempted out of their native 
fastnesses as it does the wolves in a hard winter.&nbsp; Writing 
and receiving letters from America was one of the principal 
occupations, and an epistle descriptive of a particular event at 
home went the rounds, and was eagerly read and discussed.</p>
<p>The merits of the different <i>pensions</i> also formed a 
subject of vital interest.&nbsp; The advantages and disadvantages
of these rival establishments were, as a topic, never 
exhausted.&nbsp; <i>Madame une telle</i> gave five o&rsquo;clock 
tea, included in the seven francs a day, but her rival gave one 
more meat course at dinner and her coffee was certainly better, 
while a third undoubtedly had a nicer set of people.&nbsp; No one
here at home can realize the importance these matters gradually 
assume in the eyes of the exiles.&nbsp; Their slender incomes 
have to be so carefully handled to meet the strain of even this 
simple way of living, if they are to show a surplus for a little 
trip to the seashore in the summer months, that an extra franc a 
day becomes a serious consideration.</p>
<p>Every now and then a family stronger-minded than the others, 
or with serious reasons for returning home (a daughter to bring 
out or a son to put into business), would break away from its 
somnolent surroundings and re-cross the Atlantic, alternating 
between hope and fear.&nbsp; It is here that a sad fate awaits 
these modern Rip Van Winkles.&nbsp; They find their native cities
changed beyond recognition.&nbsp; (For we move fast in these 
days.)&nbsp; The mother gets out her visiting list of ten years 
before and is thunderstruck to find that it contains chiefly 
names of the &ldquo;dead, the divorced, and 
defaulted.&rdquo;&nbsp; The waves of a decade have washed over 
her place and the world she once belonged to knows her no 
more.&nbsp; The leaders of her day on whose aid she counted have 
retired from the fray.&nbsp; Younger, and alas! unknown faces sit
in the opera boxes and around the dinner tables where before she 
had found only friends.&nbsp; After a feeble little struggle to 
get again into the &ldquo;swim,&rdquo; the family drifts back 
across the ocean into the quiet back water of a continental town,
and goes circling around with the other twigs and dry leaves, 
moral flotsam and jetsam, thrown aside by the great rush of the 
outside world.</p>
<p>For the parents the life is not too sad.&nbsp; They have had 
their day, and are, perhaps, a little glad in their hearts of a 
quiet old age, away from the heat and sweat of the battle; but 
for the younger generation it is annihilation.&nbsp; Each year 
their circle grows smaller.&nbsp; Death takes away one member 
after another of the family, until one is left alone in a foreign
land with no ties around her, or with her far-away 
&ldquo;home,&rdquo; the latter more a name now than a 
reality.</p>
<p>A year or two ago I was taking luncheon with our consul at his
primitive villa, an hour&rsquo;s ride from the city of Tangier, a
ride made on donkey-back, as no roads exist in that sunny 
land.&nbsp; After our coffee and cigars, he took me a 
half-hour&rsquo;s walk into the wilderness around him to call on 
his nearest neighbors, whose mode of existence seemed a source of
anxiety to him.&nbsp; I found myself in the presence of two 
American ladies, the younger being certainly not less than 
seventy-five.&nbsp; To my astonishment I found they had been 
living there some thirty years, since the death of their parents,
in an isolation and remoteness impossible to describe, in an Arab
house, with native servants, &ldquo;the world forgetting, by the 
world forgot.&rdquo;&nbsp; Yet these ladies had names well known 
in New York fifty years ago.</p>
<p>The glimpse I had of their existence made me thoughtful as I 
rode home in the twilight, across a suburb none too safe for 
strangers.&nbsp; What had the future in store for those 
two?&nbsp; Or, worse still, for the survivor of those two?&nbsp; 
In contrast, I saw a certain humble &ldquo;home&rdquo; far away 
in America, where two old ladies were ending their lives 
surrounded by loving friends and relations, honored and cherished
and guarded tenderly from the rude world.</p>
<p>In big cities like Paris and Rome there is another class of 
the expatriated, the wealthy who have left their homes in a 
moment of pique after the failure of some social or political 
ambition; and who find in these centres the recognition refused 
them at home and for which their souls thirsted.</p>
<p>It is not to these I refer, although it is curious to see a 
group of people living for years in a country of which they, half
the time, do not speak the language (beyond the necessities of 
housekeeping and shopping), knowing but few of its inhabitants, 
and seeing none of the society of the place, their acquaintance 
rarely going beyond that equivocal, hybrid class that surrounds 
rich &ldquo;strangers&rdquo; and hangs on to the outer edge of 
the <i>grand monde</i>.&nbsp; One feels for this latter class 
merely contempt, but one&rsquo;s pity is reserved for the 
former.&nbsp; What object lessons some lives on the Continent 
would be to impatient souls at home, who feel discontented with 
their surroundings, and anxious to break away and wander 
abroad!&nbsp; Let them think twice before they cut the thousand 
ties it has taken a lifetime to form.&nbsp; Better monotony at 
your own fireside, my friends, where at the worst, you are known 
and have your place, no matter how small, than an old age among 
strangers.</p>
<h2>No. 12&mdash;&ldquo;Seven Ages&rdquo; of Furniture</h2>
<p>The progress through life of active-minded Americans is apt to
be a series of transformations.&nbsp; At each succeeding phase of
mental development, an old skin drops from their growing 
intelligence, and they assimilate the ideas and tastes of their 
new condition, with a facility and completeness unknown to other 
nations.</p>
<p>One series of metamorphoses particularly amusing to watch is, 
that of an observant, receptive daughter of Uncle Sam who, aided 
and followed (at a distance) by an adoring husband, gradually 
develops her excellent brain, and rises through fathoms of 
self-culture and purblind experiment, to the surface of 
dilettantism and connoisseurship.&nbsp; One can generally detect 
the exact stage of evolution such a lady has reached by the bent 
of her conversation, the books she is reading, and, last but not 
least, by her material surroundings; no outward and visible signs
reflecting inward and spiritual grace so clearly as the objects 
people collect around them for the adornment of their rooms, or 
the way in which those rooms are decorated.</p>
<p>A few years ago, when a young man and his bride set up 
housekeeping on their own account, the &ldquo;old people&rdquo; 
of both families seized the opportunity to unload on the 
beginners (under the pretence of helping them along) a quantity 
of furniture and belongings that had (as the shopkeepers say) 
&ldquo;ceased to please&rdquo; their original owners.&nbsp; The 
narrow quarters of the tyros are encumbered by ungainly sofas and
arm-chairs, most probably of carved rosewood.&nbsp; 
<i>&Eacute;tag&egrave;res</i> of the same lugubrious material 
grace the corners of their tiny drawing-room, the bits of mirror 
inserted between the shelves distorting the image of the owners 
into headless or limbless phantoms.&nbsp; Half of their little 
dining-room is filled with a black-walnut sideboard, ingeniously 
contrived to take up as much space as possible and hold nothing, 
its graceless top adorned with a stag&rsquo;s head carved in wood
and imitation antlers.</p>
<p>The novices in their innocence live contented amid their 
hideous surroundings for a year or two, when the wife enters her 
second epoch, which, for want of a better word, we will call the 
Japanese period.&nbsp; The grim furniture gradually disappears 
under a layer of silk and gauze draperies, the bare walls blossom
with paper umbrellas, fans are nailed in groups promiscuously, 
wherever an empty space offends her eye.&nbsp; Bows of ribbon are
attached to every possible protuberance of the furniture.&nbsp; 
Even the table service is not spared.&nbsp; I remember dining at 
a house in this stage of its artistic development, where the 
marrow bones that formed one course of the dinner appeared each 
with a coquettish little bow-knot of pink ribbon around its 
neck.</p>
<p>Once launched on this sea of adornment, the housewife soon 
loses her bearings and decorates indiscriminately.&nbsp; Her old 
evening dresses serve to drape the mantelpieces, and she passes 
every spare hour embroidering, braiding, or fringing some 
material to adorn her rooms.&nbsp; At Christmas her friends 
contribute specimens of their handiwork to the collection.</p>
<p>The view of other houses and other decorations before long 
introduces the worm of discontent into the blossom of our 
friend&rsquo;s contentment.&nbsp; The fruit of her labors becomes
tasteless on her lips.&nbsp; As the finances of the family are 
satisfactory, the re-arrangement of the parlor floor is (at her 
suggestion) confided to a firm of upholsterers, who make a clean 
sweep of the rosewood and the bow-knots, and retire, after some 
months of labor, leaving the delighted wife in possession of a 
suite of rooms glittering with every monstrosity that an 
imaginative tradesman, spurred on by unlimited credit, could 
devise.</p>
<p>The wood work of the doors and mantels is an intricate puzzle 
of inlaid woods, the ceilings are panelled and painted in 
complicated designs.&nbsp; The &ldquo;parlor&rdquo; is provided 
with a complete set of neat, old-gold satin furniture, puffed at 
its angles with peacock-colored plush.</p>
<p>The monumental folding doors between the long, narrow rooms 
are draped with the same chaste combination of stuffs.</p>
<p>The dining-room blazes with a gold and purple wall paper, set 
off by ebonized wood work and furniture.&nbsp; The conscientious 
contractor has neglected no corner.&nbsp; Every square inch of 
the ceilings, walls, and floors has been carved, embossed, 
stencilled, or gilded into a bewildering monotony.</p>
<p>The husband, whose affairs are rapidly increasing on his 
hands, has no time to attend to such insignificant details as 
house decoration, the wife has perfect confidence in the taste of
the firm employed.&nbsp; So at the suggestion of the latter, and 
in order to complete the beauty of the rooms, a Bouguereau, a 
Toulmouche and a couple of Schreyers are bought, and a number of 
modern French bronzes scattered about on the multicolored 
cabinets.&nbsp; Then, at last, the happy owners of all this 
splendor open their doors to the admiration of their friends.</p>
<p>About the time the peacock plush and the gilding begin to show
signs of wear and tear, rumors of a fresh fashion in decoration 
float across from England, and the new gospel of the beautiful 
according to Clarence Cook is first preached to an astonished 
nation.</p>
<p>The fortune of our couple continuing to develop with pleasing 
rapidity, the building of a country house is next decided 
upon.&nbsp; A friend of the husband, who has recently started out
as an architect, designs them a picturesque residence without a 
straight line on its exterior or a square room inside.&nbsp; This
house is done up in strict obedience to the teachings of the new 
sect.&nbsp; The dining-room is made about as cheerful as the 
entrance to a family vault.&nbsp; The rest of the house bears a 
close resemblance to an ecclesiastical junk shop.&nbsp; The 
entrance hall is filled with what appears to be a communion table
in solid oak, and the massive chairs and settees of the parlor 
suggest the withdrawing room of Rowena, &aelig;sthetic shades of 
momie-cloth drape deep-set windows, where an&aelig;mic and 
disjointed females in stained glass pluck conventional roses.</p>
<p>To each of these successive transitions the husband has 
remained obediently and tranquilly indifferent.&nbsp; He has in 
his heart considered them all equally unfitting and uncomfortable
and sighed in regretful memory of a deep, old-fashioned arm-chair
that sheltered his after-dinner naps in the early rosewood 
period.&nbsp; So far he has been as clay in the hands of his 
beloved wife, but the an&aelig;mic ladies and the communion table
are the last drop that causes his cup to overflow.&nbsp; He 
revolts and begins to take matters into his own hands with the 
result that the household enters its fifth incarnation under his 
guidance, during which everything is painted white and all the 
wall-papers are a vivid scarlet.&nbsp; The family sit on bogus 
Chippendale and eat off blue and white china.</p>
<p>With the building of their grand new house near the park the 
couple rise together into the sixth cycle of their 
development.&nbsp; Having travelled and studied the epochs by 
this time, they can tell a Louis XIV. from a Louis XV. room, and 
recognize that mahogany and brass sphinxes denote furniture of 
the Empire.&nbsp; This newly acquired knowledge is, however, 
vague and hazy.&nbsp; They have no confidence in themselves, so 
give over the fitting of their principal floors to the New York 
branch of a great French house.&nbsp; Little is talked of now but
periods, plans, and elevations.&nbsp; Under the guidance of the 
French firm, they acquire at vast expense, faked reproductions as
historic furniture.</p>
<p>The spacious rooms are sticky with new gilding, and the 
flowered brocades of the hangings and furniture crackle to the 
touch.&nbsp; The rooms were not designed by the architect to 
receive any special kind of &ldquo;treatment.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
Immense folding-doors unite the salons, and windows open 
anywhere.&nbsp; The decorations of the walls have been applied 
like a poultice, regardless of the proportions of the rooms and 
the distribution of the spaces.</p>
<p>Building and decorating are, however, the best of 
educations.&nbsp; The husband, freed at last from his business 
occupations, finds in this new study an interest and a charm 
unknown to him before.&nbsp; He and his wife are both vaguely 
disappointed when their resplendent mansion is finished, having 
already outgrown it, and recognize that in spite of correct 
detail, their costly apartments no more resemble the stately and 
simple salons seen abroad than the cabin of a Fall River boat 
resembles the <i>Galerie des Glaces</i> at Versailles.&nbsp; The 
humiliating knowledge that they are all wrong breaks upon them, 
as it is doing on hundreds of others, at the same time as the 
desire to know more and appreciate better the perfect productions
of this art.</p>
<p>A seventh and last step is before them but they know not how 
to make it.&nbsp; A surer guide than the upholsterer is, they 
know, essential, but their library contains nothing to help 
them.&nbsp; Others possess the information they need, yet they 
are ignorant where to turn for what they require.</p>
<p>With singular appropriateness a volume treating of this 
delightful &ldquo;art&rdquo; has this season appeared at 
Scribner&rsquo;s.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Decoration of Houses&rdquo; is
the result of a woman&rsquo;s faultless taste collaborating with 
a man&rsquo;s technical knowledge.&nbsp; Its mission is to reveal
to the hundreds who have advanced just far enough to find that 
they can go no farther alone, truths lying concealed beneath the 
surface.&nbsp; It teaches that consummate taste is satisfied only
with a perfected simplicity; that the facades of a house must be 
the envelope of the rooms within and adapted to them, as the 
rooms are to the habits and requirements of them &ldquo;that 
dwell therein;&rdquo; that proportion is the backbone of the 
decorator&rsquo;s art and that supreme elegance is fitness and 
moderation; and, above all, that an attention to architectural 
principles can alone lead decoration to a perfect 
development.</p>
<h2>No. 13&mdash;Our Elite and Public Life</h2>
<p>The complaint is so often heard, and seems so well founded, 
that there is a growing inclination, not only among men of social
position, but also among our best and cleverest citizens, to 
stand aloof from public life, and this reluctance on their part 
is so unfortunate, that one feels impelled to seek out the causes
where they must lie, beneath the surface.&nbsp; At a first glance
they are not apparent.&nbsp; Why should not the honor of 
representing one&rsquo;s town or locality be as eagerly sought 
after with us as it is by English or French men of 
position?&nbsp; That such is not the case, however, is 
evident.</p>
<p>Speaking of this the other evening, over my after-dinner 
coffee, with a high-minded and public-spirited gentleman, who not
long ago represented our country at a European court, he advanced
two theories which struck me as being well worth repeating, and 
which seemed to account to a certain extent for this curious 
abstinence.</p>
<p>As a first and most important cause, he placed the fact that 
neither our national nor (here in New York) our state capital 
coincides with our metropolis.&nbsp; In this we differ from 
England and all the continental countries.&nbsp; The result is 
not difficult to perceive.&nbsp; In London, a man of the world, a
business man, or a great lawyer, who represents a locality in 
Parliament, can fulfil his mandate and at the same time lead his 
usual life among his own set.&nbsp; The lawyer or the business 
man can follow during the day his profession, or those affairs on
which he depends to support his family and his position in the 
world.&nbsp; Then, after dinner (owing to the peculiar hours 
adopted for the sittings of Parliament), he can take his place as
a law-maker.&nbsp; If he be a London-born man, he in no way 
changes his way of life or that of his family.&nbsp; If, on the 
contrary, he be a county magnate, the change he makes is all for 
the better, as it takes him and his wife and daughters up to 
London, the haven of their longings, and the centre of all sorts 
of social dissipations and advancement.</p>
<p>With us, it is exactly the contrary.&nbsp; As the District of 
Columbia elects no one, everybody living in Washington officially
is more or less expatriated, and the social life it offers is a 
poor substitute for the circle which most families leave to go 
there.</p>
<p>That, however, is not the most important side of the 
question.&nbsp; Go to any great lawyer of either New York or 
Chicago, and propose sending him to Congress or the Senate.&nbsp;
His answer is sure to be, &ldquo;I cannot afford it.&nbsp; I know
it is an honor, but what is to replace the hundred thousand 
dollars a year which my profession brings me in, not to mention 
that all my practice would go to pieces during my 
absence?&rdquo;&nbsp; Or again, &ldquo;How should I dare to 
propose to my family to leave one of the great centres of the 
country to go and vegetate in a little provincial city like 
Washington?&nbsp; No, indeed!&nbsp; Public life is out of the 
question for me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Does any one suppose England would have the class of men she 
gets in Parliament, if that body sat at Bristol?</p>
<p>Until recently the man who occupied the position of Lord 
Chancellor made thirty thousand pounds a year by his profession 
without interfering in any way with his public duties, and at the
present moment a recordership in London in no wise prevents 
private practice.&nbsp; Were these gentlemen Americans, they 
would be obliged to renounce all hope of professional income in 
order to serve their country at its Capital.</p>
<p>Let us glance for a moment at the other reason.&nbsp; Owing to
our laws (doubtless perfectly reasonable, and which it is not my 
intention to criticise,) a man must reside in the place he 
represents.&nbsp; Here again we differ from all other 
constitutional countries.&nbsp; Unfortunately, our clever young 
men leave the small towns of their birth and flock up to the 
great centres as offering wider fields for their 
advancement.&nbsp; In consequence, the local elector finds his 
choice limited to what is left&mdash;the intellectual skimmed 
milk, of which the cream has been carried to New York or other 
big cities.&nbsp; No country can exist without a metropolis, and 
as such a centre by a natural law of assimilation absorbs the 
best brains of the country, in other nations it has been found to
the interests of all parties to send down brilliant young men to 
the &ldquo;provinces,&rdquo; to be, in good time, returned by 
them to the national assemblies.</p>
<p>As this is not a political article the simple indication of 
these two causes will suffice, without entering into the question
of their reasonableness or of their justice.&nbsp; The social 
bearing of such a condition is here the only side of the question
under discussion; it is difficult to over-rate the influence that
a man&rsquo;s family exert over his decisions.</p>
<p>Political ambition is exceedingly rare among our women of 
position; when the American husband is bitten with it, the wife 
submits to, rather than abets, his inclinations.&nbsp; In most 
cases our women are not cosmopolitan enough to enjoy being 
transplanted far away from their friends and relations, even to 
fill positions of importance and honor.&nbsp; A New York woman of
great frankness and intelligence, who found herself recently in a
Western city under these circumstances, said, in answer to a 
flattering remark that &ldquo;the ladies of the place expected 
her to become their social leader,&rdquo; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t 
see anything to lead,&rdquo; thus very plainly expressing her 
opinion of the situation.&nbsp; It is hardly fair to expect a 
woman accustomed to the life of New York or the foreign capitals,
to look forward with enthusiasm to a term of years passed in 
Albany, or in Washington.</p>
<p>In France very much the same state of affairs has been reached
by quite a different route.&nbsp; The aristocracy detest the 
present government, and it is not considered &ldquo;good 
form&rdquo; by them to sit in the Chamber of Deputies or to 
accept any but diplomatic positions.&nbsp; They condescend to 
fill the latter because that entails living away from their own 
country, as they feel more at ease in foreign courts than at the 
Republican receptions of the Elys&eacute;e.</p>
<p>There is a deplorable tendency among our self-styled 
aristocracy to look upon their circle as a class apart.&nbsp; 
They separate themselves more each year from the life of the 
country, and affect to smile at any of their number who honestly 
wish to be of service to the nation.&nbsp; They, like the French 
aristocracy, are perfectly willing, even anxious, to fill 
agreeable diplomatic posts at first-class foreign capitals, and 
are na&iuml;vely astonished when their offers of service are not 
accepted with gratitude by the authorities in Washington.&nbsp; 
But let a husband propose to his better half some humble position
in the machinery of our government, and see what the lady&rsquo;s
answer will be.</p>
<p>The opinion prevails among a large class of our wealthy and 
cultivated people, that to go into public life is to descend to 
duties beneath them.&nbsp; They judge the men who occupy such 
positions with insulting severity, classing them in their minds 
as corrupt and self-seeking, than which nothing can be more 
childish or more imbecile.&nbsp; Any observer who has lived in 
the different grades of society will quickly renounce the puerile
idea that sporting or intellectual pursuits are alone worthy of a
gentleman&rsquo;s attention.&nbsp; This very political life, 
which appears unworthy of their attention to so many men, is, in 
reality, the great field where the nations of the world fight out
their differences, where the seed is sown that will ripen later 
into vast crops of truth and justice.&nbsp; It is (if rightly 
regarded and honestly followed) the battle-ground where 
man&rsquo;s highest qualities are put to their noblest 
use&mdash;that of working for the happiness of others.</p>
<h2>No. 14&mdash;The Small Summer Hotel</h2>
<p>We certainly are the most eccentric race on the surface of the
globe and ought to be a delight to the soul of an explorer, so 
full is our civilization of contradictions, unexplained habits 
and curious customs.&nbsp; It is quite unnecessary for the 
inquisitive gentlemen who pass their time prying into other 
people&rsquo;s affairs and then returning home to write books 
about their discoveries, to risk their lives and digestions in 
long journeys into Central Africa or to the frozen zones, while 
so much good material lies ready to their hands in our own 
land.&nbsp; The habits of the &ldquo;natives&rdquo; in New 
England alone might occupy an active mind indefinitely, offering 
as interesting problems as any to be solved by penetrating 
Central Asia or visiting the man-eating tribes of Australia.</p>
<p>Perhaps one of our scientific celebrities, before undertaking 
his next long voyage, will find time to make observations at home
and collect sufficient data to answer some questions that have 
long puzzled my unscientific brain.&nbsp; He would be doing good 
work.&nbsp; Fame and honors await the man who can explain why, 
for instance, sane Americans of the better class, with money 
enough to choose their surroundings, should pass so much of their
time in hotels and boarding houses.&nbsp; There must be a reason 
for the vogue of these retreats&mdash;every action has a cause, 
however remote.&nbsp; I shall await with the deepest interest a 
paper on this subject from one of our great explorers, untoward 
circumstances having some time ago forced me to pass a few days 
in a popular establishment of this class.</p>
<p>During my visit I amused myself by observing the inmates and 
trying to discover why they had come there.&nbsp; So far as I 
could find out, the greater part of them belonged to our 
well-to-do class, and when at home doubtless lived in luxurious 
houses and were waited on by trained servants.&nbsp; In the small
summer hotel where I met them, they were living in dreary little 
ten by twelve foot rooms, containing only the absolute 
necessities of existence, a wash-stand, a bureau, two chairs and 
a bed.&nbsp; And such a bed!&nbsp; One mattress about four inches
thick over squeaking slats, cotton sheets, so nicely calculated 
to the size of the bed that the slightest move on the part of the
sleeper would detach them from their moorings and undo the 
housemaid&rsquo;s work; two limp, discouraged pillows that had 
evidently been &ldquo;banting,&rdquo; and a few towels a foot 
long with a surface like sand-paper, completed the fittings of 
the room.&nbsp; Baths were unknown, and hot water was a luxury 
distributed sparingly by a capricious handmaiden.&nbsp; It is 
only fair to add that everything in the room was perfectly clean,
as was the coarse table linen in the dining room.</p>
<p>The meals were in harmony with the rooms and furniture, 
consisting only of the strict necessities, cooked with a Spartan 
disregard for such sybarite foibles as seasoning or 
dressing.&nbsp; I believe there was a substantial meal somewhere 
in the early morning hours, but I never succeeded in getting down
in time to inspect it.&nbsp; By successful bribery, I induced one
of the village belles, who served at table, to bring a cup of 
coffee to my room.&nbsp; The first morning it appeared already 
poured out in the cup, with sugar and cold milk added at her 
discretion.&nbsp; At one o&rsquo;clock a dinner was served, 
consisting of soup (occasionally), one meat dish and attendant 
vegetables, a meagre dessert, and nothing else.&nbsp; At 
half-past six there was an equally rudimentary meal, called 
&ldquo;tea,&rdquo; after which no further food was distributed to
the inmates, who all, however, seemed perfectly contented with 
this arrangement.&nbsp; In fact they apparently looked on the act
of eating as a disagreeable task, to be hurried through as soon 
as possible that they might return to their aimless rocking and 
chattering.</p>
<p>Instead of dinner hour being the feature of the day, uniting 
people around an attractive table, and attended by conversation, 
and the meal lasting long enough for one&rsquo;s food to be 
properly eaten, it was rushed through as though we were all 
trying to catch a train.&nbsp; Then, when the meal was over, the 
boarders relapsed into apathy again.</p>
<p>No one ever called this hospitable home a boarding-house, for 
the proprietor was furious if it was given that name.&nbsp; He 
also scorned the idea of keeping a hotel.&nbsp; So that I never 
quite understood in what relation he stood toward us.&nbsp; He 
certainly considered himself our host, and ignored the financial 
side of the question severely.&nbsp; In order not to hurt his 
feelings by speaking to him of money, we were obliged to get our 
bills by strategy from a male subordinate.&nbsp; Mine host and 
his family were apparently unaware that there were people under 
their roof who paid them for board and lodging.&nbsp; We were all
looked upon as guests and &ldquo;entertained,&rdquo; and our 
rights impartially ignored.</p>
<p>Nothing, I find, is so distinctive of New England as this 
graceful veiling of the practical side of life.&nbsp; The 
landlady always reminded me, by her manner, of Barrie&rsquo;s 
description of the bill-sticker&rsquo;s wife who 
&ldquo;cut&rdquo; her husband when she chanced to meet him 
&ldquo;professionally&rdquo; engaged.&nbsp; As a result of this 
extreme detachment from things material, the house ran itself, or
was run by incompetent Irish and negro &ldquo;help.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
There were no bells in the rooms, which simplified the service, 
and nothing could be ordered out of meal hours.</p>
<p>The material defects in board and lodging sink, however, into 
insignificance before the moral and social unpleasantness of an 
establishment such as this.&nbsp; All ages, all conditions, and 
all creeds are promiscuously huddled together.&nbsp; It is 
impossible to choose whom one shall know or whom avoid.&nbsp; A 
horrible burlesque of family life is enabled, with all its 
inconveniences and none of its sanctity.&nbsp; People from 
different cities, with different interests and standards, are 
expected to &ldquo;chum&rdquo; together in an intimacy that 
begins with the eight o&rsquo;clock breakfast and ends only when 
all retire for the night.&nbsp; No privacy, no isolation is 
allowed.&nbsp; If you take a book and begin to read in a remote 
corner of a parlor or piazza, some idle matron or idiotic girl 
will tranquilly invade your poor little bit of privacy and gabble
of her affairs and the day&rsquo;s gossip.&nbsp; There is no 
escape unless you mount to your ten-by-twelve cell and sit (like 
the Premiers of England when they visit Balmoral) on the bed, to 
do your writing, for want of any other conveniences.&nbsp; Even 
such retirement is resented by the boarders.&nbsp; You are 
thought to be haughty and to give yourself airs if you do not sit
for twelve consecutive hours each day in unending conversation 
with them.</p>
<p>When one reflects that thousands of our countrymen pass at 
least one-half of their lives in these asylums, and that 
thousands more in America know no other homes, but move from one 
hotel to another, while the same outlay would procure them cosy, 
cheerful dwellings, it does seem as if these modern Arabs, 
Holmes&rsquo;s &ldquo;Folding Bed-ouins,&rdquo; were gradually 
returning to prehistoric habits and would end by eating roots 
promiscuously in caves.</p>
<p>The contradiction appears more marked the longer one reflects 
on the love of independence and impatience of all restraint that 
characterize our race.&nbsp; If such an institution had been 
conceived by people of the Old World, accustomed to moral slavery
and to a thousand petty tyrannies, it would not be so remarkable,
but that we, of all the races of the earth, should have created a
form of torture unknown to Louis XI. or to the Spanish 
Inquisitors, is indeed inexplicable!&nbsp; Outside of this happy 
land the institution is unknown.&nbsp; The <i>pension</i> when it
exists abroad, is only an exotic growth for an American 
market.&nbsp; Among European nations it is undreamed of; the 
poorest when they travel take furnished rooms, where they are 
served in private, or go to restaurants or <i>table 
d&rsquo;h&ocirc;tes</i> for their meals.&nbsp; In a strictly 
continental hotel the public parlor does not exist.&nbsp; People 
do not travel to make acquaintances, but for health or 
recreation, or to improve their minds.&nbsp; The enforced 
intimacy of our American family house, with its attendant 
quarrelling and back-biting, is an infliction of which Europeans 
are in happy ignorance.</p>
<p>One explanation, only, occurs to me, which is that among New 
England people, largely descended from Puritan stock, there still
lingers some blind impulse at self-mortification, an hereditary 
inclination to make this life as disagreeable as possible by 
self-immolation.&nbsp; Their ancestors, we are told by Macaulay, 
suppressed bull baiting, not because it hurt the bull, but 
because it gave pleasure to the people.&nbsp; Here in New England
they refused the Roman dogma of Purgatory and then with complete 
inconsistency, invented the boarding-house, in order, doubtless, 
to take as much of the joy as possible out of this life, as a 
preparation for endless bliss in the next.</p>
<h2>No. 15&mdash;A False Start</h2>
<p>Having had, during a wandering existence, many opportunities 
of observing my compatriots away from home and familiar 
surroundings in various circles of cosmopolitan society, at 
foreign courts, in diplomatic life, or unofficial capacities, I 
am forced to acknowledge that whereas my countrywoman invariably 
assumed her new position with grace and dignity, my countryman, 
in the majority of cases, appeared at a disadvantage.</p>
<p>I take particular pleasure in making this tribute to my 
&ldquo;sisters&rdquo; tact and wit, as I have been accused of 
being &ldquo;hard&rdquo; on American women, and some 
half-humorous criticisms have been taken seriously by 
over-susceptible women&mdash;doubtless troubled with guilty 
consciences for nothing is more exact than the old French 
proverb, &ldquo;It is only the truth that wounds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fact remains clear, however, that American men, as regards
polish, facility in expressing themselves in foreign languages, 
the arts of pleasing and entertaining, in short, the thousand and
one nothings composing that agreeable whole, a cultivated member 
of society, are inferior to their womankind.&nbsp; I feel sure 
that all Americans who have travelled and have seen their 
compatriot in his social relations with foreigners, will agree 
with this, reluctant as I am to acknowledge it.</p>
<p>That a sister and brother brought up together, under the same 
influences, should later differ to this extent seems 
incredible.&nbsp; It is just this that convinces me we have made 
a false start as regards the education and ambitions of our young
men.</p>
<p>To find the reasons one has only to glance back at our 
past.&nbsp; After the struggle that insured our existence as a 
united nation, came a period of great prosperity.&nbsp; When both
seemed secure, we did not pause and take breath, as it were, 
before entering a new epoch of development, but dashed ahead on 
the old lines.&nbsp; It is here that we got on the wrong 
road.&nbsp; Naturally enough too, for our peculiar position on 
this continent, far away from the centres of cultivation and art,
surrounded only by less successful states with which to compare 
ourselves, has led us into forming erroneous ideas as to the 
proportions of things, causing us to exaggerate the value of 
material prosperity and undervalue matters of infinitely greater 
importance, which have been neglected in consequence.</p>
<p>A man who, after fighting through our late war, had succeeded 
in amassing a fortune, naturally wished his son to follow him on 
the only road in which it had ever occurred to him that success 
was of any importance.&nbsp; So beyond giving the boy a college 
education, which he had not enjoyed, his ambition rarely went; 
his idea being to make a practical business man of him, or a 
lawyer, that he could keep the estate together more 
intelligently.&nbsp; In thousands of cases, of course, individual
taste and bent over-ruled this influence, and a career of science
or art was chosen; but in the mass of the American people, it was
firmly implanted that the pursuit of wealth was the only 
occupation to which a reasonable human being could devote 
himself.&nbsp; A young man who was not in some way engaged in 
increasing his income was looked upon as a very undesirable 
member of society, and sure, sooner or later, to come to 
harm.</p>
<p>Millionaires declined to send their sons to college, saying 
they would get ideas there that would unfit them for business, to
Paterfamilias the one object of life.&nbsp; Under such fostering 
influences, the ambitions in our country have gradually given way
to money standards and the false start has been made!&nbsp; 
Leaving aside at once the question of money in its relation to 
our politics (although it would be a fruitful subject for 
moralizing), and confining ourselves strictly to the social side 
of life, we soon see the results of this mammon worship.</p>
<p>In England (although Englishmen have been contemptuously 
called the shop-keepers of the world) the extension and 
maintenance of their vast empire is the mainspring which keeps 
the great machine in movement.&nbsp; And one sees tens of 
thousands of well-born and delicately-bred men cheerfully 
entering the many branches of public service where the hope of 
wealth can never come, and retiring on pensions or half-pay in 
the strength of their middle age, apparently without a regret or 
a thought beyond their country&rsquo;s well-being.</p>
<p>In France, where the passionate love of their own land has 
made colonial extension impossible, the modern Frenchman of 
education is more interested in the yearly exhibition at the 
<i>Salon</i> or in a successful play at the 
<i>Fran&ccedil;ais</i>, than in the stock markets of the 
world.</p>
<p>Would that our young men had either of these bents!&nbsp; They
have copied from England a certain love of sport, without the 
English climate or the calm of country and garrison life, to make
these sports logical and necessary.&nbsp; As the young American 
millionaire thinks he must go on increasing his fortune, we see 
the anomaly of a man working through a summer&rsquo;s day in Wall
Street, then dashing in a train to some suburban club, and 
appearing a half-hour later on the polo field.&nbsp; Next to 
wealth, sport has become the ambition of the wealthy classes, and
has grown so into our college life that the number of students in
the freshman class of our great universities is seriously 
influenced by that institution&rsquo;s losses or gains at 
football.</p>
<p>What is the result of all this?&nbsp; A young man starts in 
life with the firm intention of making a great deal of 
money.&nbsp; If he has any time left from that occupation he will
devote it to sport.&nbsp; Later in life, when he has leisure and 
travels, or is otherwise thrown with cultivated strangers, he 
must naturally be at a disadvantage.&nbsp; &ldquo;Shop,&rdquo; he
cannot talk; he knows that is vulgar.&nbsp; Music, art, the 
drama, and literature are closed books to him, in spite of the 
fact that he may have a box on the grand tier at the opera and a 
couple of dozen high-priced &ldquo;masterpieces&rdquo; hanging 
around his drawing-rooms.&nbsp; If he is of a finer clay than the
general run of his class, he will realize dimly that somehow the 
goal has been missed in his life race.&nbsp; His chase after the 
material has left him so little time to cultivate the ideal, that
he has prepared himself a sad and aimless old age; unless he can 
find pleasure in doing as did a man I have been told about, who, 
receiving half a dozen millions from his father&rsquo;s estate, 
conceived the noble idea of increasing them so that he might 
leave to each of his four children as much as he had himself 
received.&nbsp; With the strictest economy, and by suppressing 
out of his life and that of his children all amusements and 
superfluous outlay, he has succeeded now for many years in living
on the income of his income.&nbsp; Time will never hang heavy on 
this Harpagon&rsquo;s hands.&nbsp; He is a perfectly happy 
individual, but his conversation is hardly of a kind to attract, 
and it may be doubted if the rest of the family are as much to be
envied.</p>
<p>An artist who had lived many years of his life in Paris and 
London was speaking the other day of a curious phase he had 
remarked in our American life.&nbsp; He had been accustomed over 
there to have his studio the meeting-place of friends, who would 
drop in to smoke and lounge away an hour, chatting as he 
worked.&nbsp; To his astonishment, he tells me that since he has 
been in New York not one of the many men he knows has ever passed
an hour in his rooms.&nbsp; Is not that a significant fact?&nbsp;
Another remark which points its own moral was repeated to me 
recently.&nbsp; A foreigner visiting here, to whom American 
friends were showing the sights of our city, exclaimed at last: 
&ldquo;You have not pointed out to me any celebrities except 
millionaires.&nbsp; &lsquo;Do you see that man? he is worth ten 
millions.&nbsp; Look at that house! it cost one million dollars, 
and there are pictures in it worth over three million 
dollars.&nbsp; That trotter cost one hundred thousand 
dollars,&rsquo; etc.&rdquo;&nbsp; Was he not right?&nbsp; And 
does it not give my reader a shudder to see in black and white 
the phrases that are, nevertheless, so often on our lips?</p>
<p>This levelling of everything to its cash value is so ingrained
in us that we are unconscious of it, as we are of using slang or 
local expressions until our attention is called to them.&nbsp; I 
was present once at a farce played in a London theatre, where the
audience went into roars of laughter every time the stage 
American said, &ldquo;Why, certainly.&rdquo;&nbsp; I was 
indignant, and began explaining to my English friend that we 
never used such an absurd phrase.&nbsp; &ldquo;Are you 
sure?&rdquo; he asked.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why, certainly,&rdquo; I 
said, and stopped, catching the twinkle in his eye.</p>
<p>It is very much the same thing with money.&nbsp; We do not 
notice how often it slips into the conversation.&nbsp; &ldquo;Out
of the fullness of the heart the mouth speaketh.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
Talk to an American of a painter and the charm of his work.&nbsp;
He will be sure to ask, &ldquo;Do his pictures sell well?&rdquo; 
and will lose all interest if you say he can&rsquo;t sell them at
all.&nbsp; As if that had anything to do with it!</p>
<p>Remembering the well-known anecdote of Schopenhauer and the 
gold piece which he used to put beside his plate at the <i>table 
d&rsquo;h&ocirc;te</i>, where he ate, surrounded by the young 
officers of the German army, and which was to be given to the 
poor the first time he heard any conversation that was not about 
promotion or women, I have been tempted to try the experiment in 
our clubs, changing the subjects to stocks and sport, and feel 
confident that my contributions to charity would not ruin me.</p>
<p>All this has had the result of making our men dull companions;
after dinner, or at a country house, if the subject they love is 
tabooed, they talk of nothing!&nbsp; It is sad for a rich man 
(unless his mind has remained entirely between the leaves of his 
ledger) to realize that money really buys very little, and above 
a certain amount can give no satisfaction in proportion to its 
bulk, beyond that delight which comes from a sense of 
possession.&nbsp; Croesus often discovers as he grows old that he
has neglected to provide himself with the only thing that 
&ldquo;is a joy for ever&rdquo;&mdash;a cultivated 
intellect&mdash;in order to amass a fortune that turns to ashes, 
when he has time to ask of it any of the pleasures and resources 
he fondly imagined it would afford him.&nbsp; Like 
Talleyrand&rsquo;s young man who would not learn whist, he finds 
that he has prepared for himself a dreadful old age!</p>
<h2>No. 16&mdash;A Holy Land</h2>
<p>Not long ago an article came under my notice descriptive of 
the neighborhood around Grant&rsquo;s tomb and the calm that 
midsummer brings to that vicinity, laughingly referred to as the 
&ldquo;Holy Land.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As careless fingers wandering over the strings of a violin may
unintentionally strike a chord, so the writer of those lines, all
unconsciously, with a jest, set vibrating a world of tender 
memories and associations; for the region spoken of is truly a 
holy land to me, the playground of my youth, and connected with 
the sweetest ties that can bind one&rsquo;s thoughts to the 
past.</p>
<p>Ernest Renan in his <i>Souvenirs d&rsquo;Enfance</i>, tells of
a Brittany legend, firmly believed in that wild land, of the 
vanished city of &ldquo;Is,&rdquo; which ages ago disappeared 
beneath the waves.&nbsp; The peasants still point out at a 
certain place on the coast the site of the fabled city, and the 
fishermen tell how during great storms they have caught glimpses 
of its belfries and ramparts far down between the waves; and 
assert that on calm summer nights they can hear the bells chiming
up from those depths.&nbsp; I also have a vanished 
&ldquo;Is&rdquo; in my heart, and as I grow older, I love to 
listen to the murmurs that float up from the past.&nbsp; They 
seem to come from an infinite distance, almost like echoes from 
another life.</p>
<p>At that enchanted time we lived during the summers in an old 
wooden house my father had re-arranged into a fairly comfortable 
dwelling.&nbsp; A tradition, which no one had ever taken the 
trouble to verify, averred that Washington had once lived there, 
which made that hero very real to us.&nbsp; The picturesque old 
house stood high on a slope where the land rises boldly; with an 
admirable view of distant mountain, river and opposing 
Palisades.</p>
<p>The new Riverside drive (which, by the bye, should make us 
very lenient toward the men who robbed our city a score of years 
ago, for they left us that vast work in atonement), has so 
changed the neighborhood it is impossible now for pious feet to 
make a pilgrimage to those childish shrines.&nbsp; One house, 
however, still stands as when it was our nearest neighbor.&nbsp; 
It had sheltered General Gage, land for many acres around had 
belonged to him.&nbsp; He was an enthusiastic gardener, and 
imported, among a hundred other fruits and plants, the 
&ldquo;Queen Claude&rdquo; plum from France, which was 
successfully acclimated on his farm.&nbsp; In New York a plum of 
that kind is still called a &ldquo;green gage.&rdquo;&nbsp; The 
house has changed hands many times since we used to play around 
the Grecian pillars of its portico.&nbsp; A recent owner, 
dissatisfied doubtless with its classic simplicity, has painted 
it a cheerful mustard color and crowned it with a fine new 
<i>Mansard</i> roof.&nbsp; Thus disfigured, and shorn of its 
surrounding trees, the poor old house stands blankly by the 
roadside, reminding one of the Greek statue in Anstey&rsquo;s 
&ldquo;Painted Venus&rdquo; after the London barber had decorated
her to his taste.&nbsp; When driving by there now, I close my 
eyes.</p>
<p>Another house, where we used to be taken to play, was that of 
Audubon, in the park of that name.&nbsp; Many a rainy afternoon I
have passed with his children choosing our favorite birds in the 
glass cases that filled every nook and corner of the tumble-down 
old place, or turning over the leaves of the enormous volumes he 
would so graciously take down from their places for our 
amusement.&nbsp; I often wonder what has become of those vast 
<i>in-folios</i>, and if any one ever opens them now and admires 
as we did the glowing colored plates in which the old 
ornithologist took such pride.&nbsp; There is something 
infinitely sad in the idea of a collection of books slowly 
gathered together at the price of privations and sacrifices, 
cherished, fondled, lovingly read, and then at the owner&rsquo;s 
death, coldly sent away to stand for ever unopened on the shelves
of some public library.&nbsp; It is like neglecting poor dumb 
children!</p>
<p>An event that made a profound impression on my childish 
imagination occurred while my father, who was never tired of 
improving our little domain, was cutting a pathway down the steep
side of the slope to the river.&nbsp; A great slab, dislodged by 
a workman&rsquo;s pick, fell disclosing the grave of an Indian 
chief.&nbsp; In a low archway or shallow cave sat the skeleton of
the chieftain, his bows and arrows arranged around him on the 
ground, mingled with fragments of an elaborate costume, of which 
little remained but the bead-work.&nbsp; That it was the tomb of 
a man great among his people was evident from the care with which
the grave had been prepared and then hidden, proving how, 
hundreds of years before our civilization, another race had 
chosen this noble cliff and stately river landscape as the 
fitting framework for a great warrior&rsquo;s tomb.</p>
<p>This discovery made no little stir in the scientific world of 
that day.&nbsp; Hundreds came to see it, and as photography had 
not then come into the world, many drawings were made and casts 
taken, and finally the whole thing was removed to the rooms of 
the Historical Society.&nbsp; From that day the lonely little 
path held an awful charm for us.&nbsp; Our childish readings of 
Cooper had developed in us that love of the Indian and his wild 
life, so characteristic of boyhood thirty years ago.&nbsp; On 
still summer afternoons, the place had a primeval calm that froze
the young blood in our veins.&nbsp; Although we prided ourselves 
on our quality as &ldquo;braves,&rdquo; and secretly pined to be 
led on the war-path, we were shy of walking in that vicinity in 
daylight, and no power on earth, not even the offer of the 
tomahawk or snow-shoes for which our souls longed, would have 
taken us there at night.</p>
<p>A place connected in my memory with a tragic association was 
across the river on the last southern slope of the 
Palisades.&nbsp; Here we stood breathless while my father told 
the brief story of the duel between Burr and Hamilton, and showed
us the rock stained by the younger man&rsquo;s life-blood.&nbsp; 
In those days there was a simple iron railing around the spot 
where Hamilton had expired, but of later years I have been unable
to find any trace of the place.&nbsp; The tide of immigration has
brought so deep a deposit of &ldquo;saloons&rdquo; and suburban 
&ldquo;balls&rdquo; that the very face of the land is changed, 
old lovers of that shore know it no more.&nbsp; Never were the 
environs of a city so wantonly and recklessly degraded.&nbsp; 
Municipalities have vied with millionaires in soiling and 
debasing the exquisite shores of our river, that, thirty years 
ago, were unrivalled the world over.</p>
<p>The glamour of the past still lies for me upon this landscape 
in spite of its many defacements.&nbsp; The river whispers of 
boyish boating parties, and the woods recall a thousand childish 
hopes and fears, resolute departures to join the pirates, or the 
red men in their strongholds&mdash;journeys boldly carried out 
until twilight cooled our courage and the supper-hour proved a 
stronger temptation than war and carnage.</p>
<p>When I sat down this summer evening to write a few lines about
happy days on the banks of the Hudson, I hardly realized how 
sweet those memories were to me.&nbsp; The rewriting of the old 
names has evoked from their long sleep so many loved faces.&nbsp;
Arms seem reaching out to me from the past.&nbsp; The house is 
very still to-night.&nbsp; I seem to be nearer my loved dead than
to the living.&nbsp; The bells of my lost &ldquo;Is&rdquo; are 
ringing clear in the silence.</p>
<h2>No. 17&mdash;Royalty At Play</h2>
<p>Few more amusing sights are to be seen in these days, than 
that of crowned heads running away from their dull old courts and
functions, roughing it in hotels and villas, gambling, yachting 
and playing at being rich nobodies.&nbsp; With much intelligence 
they have all chosen the same Republican playground, where visits
cannot possibly be twisted into meaning any new 
&ldquo;combination&rdquo; or political move, thus assuring 
themselves the freedom from care or responsibility, that seems to
be the aim of their existence.&nbsp; Alongside of well-to-do 
Royalties in good paying situations, are those out of a job, who 
are looking about for a &ldquo;place.&rdquo;&nbsp; One cannot 
take an afternoon&rsquo;s ramble anywhere between Cannes and 
Mentone without meeting a half-dozen of these magnates.</p>
<p>The other day, in one short walk, I ran across three 
Empresses, two Queens, and an Heir-apparent, and then fled to my 
hotel, fearing to be unfitted for America, if I went on 
&ldquo;keeping such company.&rdquo;&nbsp; They are knowing 
enough, these wandering great ones, and after trying many places 
have hit on this charming coast as offering more than any other 
for their comfort and enjoyment.&nbsp; The vogue of these sunny 
shores dates from their annexation to France,&mdash;a price 
Victor Emmanuel reluctantly paid for French help in his war with 
Austria.&nbsp; Napoleon III.&rsquo;s demand for Savoy and this 
littoral, was first made known to Victor Emmanuel at a state ball
at Genoa.&nbsp; Savoy was his birthplace and his home!&nbsp; The 
King broke into a wild temper, cursing the French Emperor and 
making insulting allusions to his parentage, saying he had not 
one drop of Bonaparte blood in his veins.&nbsp; The King&rsquo;s 
frightened courtiers tried to stop this outburst, showing him the
French Ambassador at his elbow.&nbsp; With a superhuman effort 
Victor Emmanuel controlled himself, and turning to the 
Ambassador, said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fear my tongue ran away with me!&rdquo;&nbsp; With a 
smile and a bow the great French diplomatist remarked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Sire</i>, I am so deaf I have not heard a word your 
Majesty has been saying!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fashion of coming to the Riviera for health or for 
amusement, dates from the sixties, when the Empress of Russia 
passed a winter at Nice, as a last attempt to prolong the 
existence of the dying Tsarewitsch, her son.&nbsp; There also the
next season the Duke of Edinburgh wooed and won her daughter 
(then the greatest heiress in Europe) for his bride.&nbsp; The 
world moves fast and a journey it required a matter of life and 
death to decide on, then, is gayly undertaken now, that a prince 
may race a yacht, or a princess try her luck at the gambling 
tables.&nbsp; When one reflects that the &ldquo;royal 
caste,&rdquo; in Europe alone, numbers some eight hundred people,
and that the East is beginning to send out its more enterprising 
crowned heads to get a taste of the fun, that beyond drawing 
their salaries, these good people have absolutely nothing to do, 
except to amuse themselves, it is no wonder that this happy land 
is crowded with royal pleasure-seekers.</p>
<p>After a try at Florence and Aix, &ldquo;the Queen&rdquo; has 
been faithful to Cimiez, a charming site back of Nice.&nbsp; That
gay city is always <i>en f&ecirc;te</i> the day she arrives, as 
her carriages pass surrounded by French cavalry, one can catch a 
glimpse of her big face, and dowdy little figure, which 
nevertheless she can make so dignified when occasion 
requires.&nbsp; The stay here is, indeed, a holiday for this 
record-breaking sovereign, who potters about her private grounds 
of a morning in a donkey-chair, sunning herself and watching her 
Battenberg grandchildren at play.&nbsp; In the afternoon, she 
drives a couple of hours&mdash;in an open carriage&mdash;one 
outrider in black livery alone distinguishing her turnout from 
the others.</p>
<p>The Prince of Wales makes his headquarters at Cannes where he 
has poor luck in sailing the Brittania, for which he consoles 
himself with jolly dinners at Monte Carlo.&nbsp; You can see him 
almost any evening in the <i>Restaurant de Paris</i>, surrounded 
by his own particular set,&mdash;the Duchess of Devonshire (who 
started a penniless German officer&rsquo;s daughter, and became 
twice a duchess); Lady de Grey and Lady Wolverton, both showing 
near six feet of slender English beauty; at their side, and 
lovelier than either, the Countess of Essex.&nbsp; The husbands 
of these &ldquo;Merry Wives&rdquo; are absent, but do not seem to
be missed, as the ladies sit smoking and laughing over their 
coffee, the party only breaking up towards eleven o&rsquo;clock 
to try its luck at <i>trente et quarante</i>, until a 
&ldquo;special&rdquo; takes them back to Cannes.</p>
<p>He is getting sadly old and fat, is England&rsquo;s heir, the 
likeness to his mamma becoming more marked each year.&nbsp; His 
voice, too, is oddly like hers, deep and guttural, more adapted 
to the paternal German (which all this family speak when alone) 
than to his native English.&nbsp; Hair, he has none, except a 
little fringe across the back of his head, just above a fine 
large roll of fat that blushes above his shirt-collar.&nbsp; Too 
bad that this discovery of the microbe of baldness comes rather 
late for him!&nbsp; He has a pleasant twinkle in his small eyes, 
and an entire absence of <i>pose</i>, that accounts largely for 
his immense and enduring popularity.</p>
<p>But the Hotel Cap Martin shelters quieter crowned heads.&nbsp;
The Emperor and Empress of Austria, who tramp about the hilly 
roads, the King and Queen of Saxony and the fat Arch-duchess 
Stephanie.&nbsp; Austria&rsquo;s Empress looks sadly changed and 
ill, as does another lady of whom one can occasionally catch a 
glimpse, walking painfully with a crutch-stick in the shadow of 
the trees near her villa.&nbsp; It is hard to believe that this 
white-haired, bent old woman was once the imperial beauty who 
from the salons of the Tuileries dictated the fashions of the 
world!&nbsp; Few have paid so dearly for their brief hour of 
splendor!</p>
<p>Cannes with its excellent harbor is the centre of interest 
during the racing season when the Tsarewitsch comes on his yacht 
Czaritza.&nbsp; At the Battle of Flowers, one is pretty sure to 
see the Duke of Cambridge, his Imperial Highness, the Grand Duke 
Michael, Prince Christian of Denmark, H.R.H. the Duke of Nassau, 
H.I.H. the Archduke Ferdinand d&rsquo;Este, their Serene 
Highnesses of Mecklenburg-Schwerin and the Saxe-Coburg-Gothas, 
also H.I.H. Marie Val&eacute;rie and the Schleswig-Holsteins, 
pelting each other and the public with <i>confetti</i> and 
flowers.&nbsp; Indeed, half the <i>Almanach de Gotha</i>, that 
continental &ldquo;society list,&rdquo; seems to be sunning 
itself here and forgetting its cares, on bicycles or on board 
yachts.&nbsp; It is said that the Crown Princess of Honolulu 
(whoever she may be) honors Mentone with her presence, and the 
newly deposed Queen &ldquo;Ranavalo&rdquo; of Madagascar is <i>en
route</i> to join in the fun.</p>
<p>This crowd of royalty reminds me of a story the old sea-dogs 
who gather about the &ldquo;Admirals&rsquo; corner&rdquo; of the 
Metropolitan Club in Washington, love to tell you.&nbsp; An 
American cockswain, dazzled by a doubly royal visit, with 
attending suites, on board the old &ldquo;Constitution,&rdquo; 
came up to his commanding officer and touching his cap, said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beg pardon, Admiral, but one of them kings has tumbled 
down the gangway and broke his leg.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It has become a much more amusing thing to wear a crown than 
it was.&nbsp; Times have changed indeed since Marie Laczinska 
lived the fifty lonely years of her wedded life and bore her many
children, in one bed-room at Versailles&mdash;a monotony only 
broken by visits to Fontainebleau or Marly.&nbsp; 
Shakespeare&rsquo;s line no longer fits the case.</p>
<p>Beyond securing rich matches for their children, and keeping a
sharp lookout that the Radicals at home do not unduly cut down 
their civil lists, these great ones have little but their 
amusements to occupy them.&nbsp; Do they ever reflect, as they 
rush about visiting each other and squabbling over precedence 
when they meet, that some fine morning the tax-payers may wake 
up, and ask each other why they are being crushed under such 
heavy loads, that eight hundred or more quite useless people may 
pass their lives in foreign watering-places, away from their 
homes and their duties?&nbsp; It will be a bad day for them when 
the long-suffering subjects say to them, &ldquo;Since we get on 
so exceedingly well during your many visits abroad, we think we 
will try how it will work without you at all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prince of little Monaco seems to be about the only one up 
to the situation, for he at least stays at home, and in 
connection with two other gentlemen runs an exceedingly good 
hotel and several restaurants on his estates, doing all he can to
attract money into the place, while making the strictest laws to 
prevent his subjects gambling at the famous tables.&nbsp; Now if 
other royalties instead of amusing themselves all the year round 
would go in for something practical like this, they might become 
useful members of the community.&nbsp; This idea of 
Monaco&rsquo;s Prince strikes one as most timely, and as opening 
a career for other indigent crowned heads.&nbsp; Hotels are 
getting so good and so numerous, that without some especial 
&ldquo;attraction&rdquo; a new one can hardly succeed; but a 
&ldquo;Hohenzollern House&rdquo; well situated in Berlin, with 
William II. to receive the tourists at the door, and his fat wife
at the desk, would be sure to prosper.&nbsp; It certainly would 
be pleasanter for him to spend money so honestly earned than the 
millions wrested from half-starving peasants which form his 
present income.&nbsp; Besides there is almost as much gold lace 
on a hotel employee&rsquo;s livery as on a court costume!</p>
<p>The numerous crowned heads one meets wandering about, can 
hardly lull themselves over their &ldquo;games&rdquo; with the 
flattering unction that they are of use, for, have they not 
France before them (which they find so much to their taste) 
stronger, richer, more respected than ever since she shook 
herself free of such incumbrances?&nbsp; Not to mention our own 
democratic country, which has managed to hold its own, in spite 
of their many gleeful predictions to the contrary.</p>
<h2>No. 18&mdash;A Rock Ahead</h2>
<p>Having had occasion several times during this past season, to 
pass by the larger stores in the vicinity of Twenty-third Street,
I have been struck more than ever, by the endless flow of 
womankind that beats against the doors of those 
establishments.&nbsp; If they were temples where a beneficent 
deity was distributing health, learning, and all the good things 
of existence, the rush could hardly have been greater.&nbsp; It 
saddened me to realize that each of the eager women I saw was, on
the contrary, dispensing something of her strength and brain, as 
well as the wearily earned stipend of the men of her family (if 
not her own), for what could be of little profit to her.</p>
<p>It occurred to me that, if the people who are so quick to talk
about the elevating and refining influences of women, could take 
an hour or two and inspect the centres in question, they might 
not be so firm in their beliefs.&nbsp; For, reluctant as I am to 
acknowledge it, the one great misfortune in this country, is the 
unnatural position which has been (from some mistaken idea of 
chivalry) accorded to women here.&nbsp; The result of placing 
them on this pedestal, and treating them as things apart, has 
been to make women in America poorer helpmeets to their husbands 
than in any other country on the face of the globe, civilized or 
uncivilized.</p>
<p>Strange as it may appear, this is not confined to the rich, 
but permeates all classes, becoming more harmful in descending 
the social scale, and it will bring about a disintegration of our
society, sooner than could be believed.&nbsp; The saying on which
we have all been brought up, viz., that you can gauge the point 
of civilization attained in a nation by the position it accords 
to woman, was quite true as long as woman was considered 
man&rsquo;s inferior.&nbsp; To make her his equal was perfectly 
just; all the trouble begins when you attempt to make her 
man&rsquo;s superior, a something apart from his working life, 
and not the companion of his troubles and cares, as she was 
intended to be.</p>
<p>When a small shopkeeper in Europe marries, the next day you 
will see his young wife taking her place at the desk in his 
shop.&nbsp; While he serves his customers, his smiling spouse 
keeps the books, makes change, and has an eye on the 
employees.&nbsp; At noon they dine together; in the evening, 
after the shop is closed, are pleased or saddened together over 
the results of the day.&nbsp; The wife&rsquo;s <i>dot</i> almost 
always goes into the business, so that there is a community of 
interest to unite them, and their lives are passed 
together.&nbsp; In this country, what happens?&nbsp; The husband 
places his new wife in a small house, or in two or three 
furnished rooms, generally so far away that all idea of dining 
with her is impossible.&nbsp; In consequence, he has a 
&ldquo;quick lunch&rdquo; down town, and does not see his wife 
between eight o&rsquo;clock in the morning and seven in the 
evening.&nbsp; His business is a closed book to her, in which she
can have no interest, for her weary husband naturally revolts 
from talking &ldquo;shop,&rdquo; even if she is in a position to 
understand him.</p>
<p>His false sense of shielding her from the rude world makes him
keep his troubles to himself, so she rarely knows his financial 
position and sulks over his &ldquo;meanness&rdquo; to her, in 
regard to pin-money; and being a perfectly idle person, her days 
are apt to be passed in a way especially devised by Satan for 
unoccupied hands.&nbsp; She has learned no cooking from her 
mother; &ldquo;going to market&rdquo; has become a thing of the 
past.&nbsp; So she falls a victim to the allurements of the 
bargain-counter; returning home after hours of aimless wandering,
irritable and aggrieved because she cannot own the beautiful 
things she has seen.&nbsp; She passes the evening in trying to 
win her husband&rsquo;s consent to some purchase he knows he 
cannot afford, while it breaks his heart to refuse her&mdash;some
object, which, were she really his companion, she would not have 
had the time to see or the folly to ask for.</p>
<p>The janitor in our building is truly a toiler.&nbsp; He rarely
leaves his dismal quarters under the sidewalk, but 
&ldquo;Madam&rdquo; walks the streets clad in sealskin and silk, 
a &ldquo;Gainsborough&rdquo; crowning her false 
&ldquo;bang.&rdquo;&nbsp; I always think of Max 
O&rsquo;Rell&rsquo;s clever saying, when I see her: &ldquo;The 
sweat of the American husband crystallizes into diamond ear-rings
for the American woman.&rdquo;&nbsp; My janitress sports a 
diminutive pair of those jewels and has hopes of larger 
ones!&nbsp; Instead of &ldquo;doing&rdquo; the bachelor&rsquo;s 
rooms in the building as her husband&rsquo;s helpmeet, she 
&ldquo;does&rdquo; her spouse, and a char-woman works for 
her.&nbsp; She is one of the drops in the tide that ebbs and 
flows on Twenty-third Street&mdash;a discontented woman placed in
a false position by our absurd customs.</p>
<p>Go a little further up in the social scale and you will find 
the same &ldquo;detached&rdquo; feeling.&nbsp; In a household I 
know of only one horse and a <i>coup&eacute;</i> can be 
afforded.&nbsp; Do you suppose it is for the use of the weary 
breadwinner?&nbsp; Not at all.&nbsp; He walks from his home to 
the &ldquo;elevated.&rdquo;&nbsp; The carriage is to take his 
wife to teas or the park.&nbsp; In a year or two she will go 
abroad, leaving him alone to turn the crank that produces the 
income.&nbsp; As it is, she always leaves him for six months each
year in a half-closed house, to the tender mercies of a 
caretaker.&nbsp; Two additional words could be advantageously 
added to the wedding service.&nbsp; After &ldquo;for richer for 
poorer,&rdquo; I should like to hear a bride promise to cling to 
her husband &ldquo;for winter for summer!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Make another step up and stand in the entrance of a house at 
two <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>, just as the cotillion is 
commencing, and watch the couples leaving.&nbsp; The husband, who
has been in Wall Street all day, knows that he must be there 
again at nine next morning.&nbsp; He is furious at the lateness 
of the hour, and dropping with fatigue.&nbsp; His wife, who has 
done nothing to weary her, is equally enraged to be taken away 
just as the ball was becoming amusing.&nbsp; What a happy, united
pair they are as the footman closes the door and the carriage 
rolls off home!&nbsp; Who is to blame?&nbsp; The husband is 
vainly trying to lead the most exacting of double lives, that of 
a business man all day and a society man all night.&nbsp; You can
pick him out at a glance in a ballroom.&nbsp; His eye shows you 
that there is no rest for him, for he has placed his wife at the 
head of an establishment whose working crushes him into the mud 
of care and anxiety.&nbsp; Has he any one to blame but 
himself?</p>
<p>In England, I am told, the man of a family goes up to London 
in the spring and gets his complete outfit, down to the smallest 
details of hat-box and umbrella.&nbsp; If there happens to be 
money left, the wife gets a new gown or two: if not, she 
&ldquo;turns&rdquo; the old ones and rejoices vicariously in the 
splendor of her &ldquo;lord.&rdquo;&nbsp; I know one charming 
little home over there, where the ladies cannot afford a 
pony-carriage, because the three indispensable hunters eat up the
where-withal.</p>
<p>Thackeray was delighted to find one household (Major 
Ponto&rsquo;s) where the governess ruled supreme, and I feel a 
fiendish pleasure in these accounts of a country where men have 
been able to maintain some rights, and am moved to preach a 
crusade for the liberation of the American husband, that the 
poor, down-trodden creature may revolt from the slavery where he 
is held and once more claim his birthright.&nbsp; If he be prompt
to act (and is successful) he may work such a reform that our 
girls, on marrying, may feel that some duties and 
responsibilities go with their new positions; and a state of 
things be changed, where it is possible for a woman to be pitied 
by her friends as a model of abnegation, because she has decided 
to remain in town during the summer to keep her husband company 
and make his weary home-coming brighter.&nbsp; Or where (as in a 
story recently heard) a foreigner on being presented to an 
American bride abroad and asking for her husband, could hear in 
answer: &ldquo;Oh, he could not come; he was too busy.&nbsp; I am
making my wedding-trip without him.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>No. 19&mdash;The Grand Prix</h2>
<p>In most cities, it is impossible to say when the 
&ldquo;season&rdquo; ends.&nbsp; In London and with us in New 
York it dwindles off without any special finish, but in Paris it 
closes like a trap-door, or the curtain on the last scene of a 
pantomime, while the lights are blazing and the orchestra is 
banging its loudest.&nbsp; The <i>Grand Prix</i>, which takes 
place on the second Sunday in June, is the climax of the spring 
gayeties.&nbsp; Up to that date, the social pace has been getting
faster and faster, like the finish of the big race itself, and 
fortunately for the lives of the women as well as the horses, 
ends as suddenly.</p>
<p>In 1897, the last steeple chase at Auteuil, which precedes the
<i>Grand Prix</i> by one week, was won by a horse belonging to an
actress of the <i>Th&eacute;&acirc;tre Fran&ccedil;ais</i>, a 
lady who has been a great deal before the public already in 
connection with the life and death of young Lebaudy.&nbsp; This 
youth having had the misfortune to inherit an enormous fortune, 
while still a mere boy, plunged into the wildest dissipation, and
became the prey of a band of sharpers and blacklegs.&nbsp; Mlle. 
Marie Louise Marsy appears to have been the one person who had a 
sincere affection for the unfortunate youth.&nbsp; When his 
health gave way during his military service, she threw over her 
engagement with the <i>Fran&ccedil;ais</i>, and nursed her lover 
until his death&mdash;a devotion rewarded by the gift of a 
million.</p>
<p>At the present moment, four or five of the band of self-styled
noblemen who traded on the boy&rsquo;s inexperience and 
generosity, are serving out terms in the state prisons for 
blackmailing, and the <i>Th&eacute;&acirc;tre Fran&ccedil;ais</i>
possesses the anomaly of a young and beautiful actress, who runs 
a racing stable in her own name.</p>
<p>The <i>Grand Prix</i> dates from the reign of Napoleon III., 
who, at the suggestion of the great railway companies, 
inaugurated this race in 1862, in imitation of the English Derby,
as a means of attracting people to Paris.&nbsp; The city and the 
railways each give half of the forty-thousand-dollar prize.&nbsp;
It is the great official race of the year.&nbsp; The President 
occupies the central pavilion, surrounded by the members of the 
cabinet and the diplomatic corps.&nbsp; On the tribunes and lawn 
can be seen the <i>Tout Paris</i>&mdash;all the celebrities of 
the great and half-world who play such an important part in the 
life of France&rsquo;s capital.&nbsp; The whole colony of the 
<i>Rastaquou&euml;res</i>, is sure to be there, 
&ldquo;<i>Rastas</i>,&rdquo; as they are familiarly called by the
Parisians, who make little if any distinction in their minds 
between a South American (blazing in diamonds and vulgar clothes)
and our own select (?) colony.&nbsp; Apropos of this inability of
the Europeans to appreciate our fine social distinctions, I have 
been told of a well-born New Yorker who took a French noblewoman 
rather to task for receiving an American she thought unworthy of 
notice, and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can you receive her?&nbsp; Her husband keeps a 
hotel!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that any reason?&rdquo; asked the French-woman; 
&ldquo;I thought all Americans kept hotels.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For the <i>Grand Prix</i>, every woman not absolutely bankrupt
has a new costume, her one idea being a <i>cr&eacute;ation</i> 
that will attract attention and eclipse her rivals.&nbsp; The 
dressmakers have had a busy time of it for weeks before.</p>
<p>Every horse that can stand up is pressed into service for the 
day.&nbsp; For twenty-four hours before, the whole city is <i>en 
f&ecirc;te</i>, and Paris <i>en f&ecirc;te</i> is always a sight 
worth seeing.&nbsp; The natural gayety of the Parisians, a 
characteristic noticed (if we are to believe the historians) as 
far back as the conquest of Gaul by Julius C&aelig;sar, breaks 
out in all its amusing spontaneity.&nbsp; If the day is fine, the
entire population gives itself up to amusement.&nbsp; From early 
morning the current sets towards the charming corner of the Bois 
where the Longchamps race-course lies, picturesquely encircled by
the Seine (alive with a thousand boats), and backed by the woody 
slopes of Suresnes and St. Cloud.&nbsp; By noon every corner and 
vantage point of the landscape is seized upon, when, with a blare
of trumpets and the rattle of cavalry, the President arrives in 
his turnout <i>&agrave; la Daumont</i>, two postilions in blue 
and gold, and a <i>piqueur</i>, preceded by a detachment of the 
showy <i>Gardes R&eacute;publicains</i> on horseback, and takes 
his place in the little pavilion where for so many years 
Eug&eacute;nie used to sit in state, and which has sheltered so 
many crowned heads under its simple roof.&nbsp; Faure&rsquo;s 
arrival is the signal for the racing to begin, from that moment 
the interest goes on increasing until the great 
&ldquo;event.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then in an instant the vast throng of 
human beings breaks up and flows homeward across the Bois, 
filling the big Place around the Arc de Triomphe, rolling down 
the Champs Elys&eacute;es, in twenty parallel lines of 
carriages.&nbsp; The sidewalks are filled with a laughing, 
singing, uproarious crowd that quickly invades every restaurant, 
<i>caf&eacute;</i>, or chop-house until their little tables 
overflow on to the grass and side-walks, and even into the middle
of the streets.&nbsp; Later in the evening the open-air concerts 
and theatres are packed, and every little square organizes its 
impromptu ball, the musicians mounted on tables, and the crowd 
dancing gayly on the wooden pavement until daybreak.</p>
<p>The next day, Paris becomes from a fashionable point of view, 
&ldquo;impossible.&rdquo;&nbsp; If you walk through the richer 
quarters, you will see only long lines of closed windows.&nbsp; 
The approaches to the railway stations are blocked with cabs 
piled with trunks and bicycles.&nbsp; The &ldquo;great 
world&rdquo; is fleeing to the seashore or its 
<i>ch&acirc;teaux</i>, and Paris will know it no more until 
January, for the French are a country-loving race, and since 
there has been no court, the aristocracy pass longer and longer 
periods on their own estates each year, partly from choice and 
largely to show their disdain for the republic and its 
entertainments.</p>
<p>The shady drives in the park, which only a day or two ago were
so brilliant with smart traps and spring toilets, are become a 
cool wilderness, where will meet, perhaps, a few maiden ladies 
exercising fat dogs, uninterrupted except by the watering-cart or
by a few stray tourists in cabs.&nbsp; Now comes a delightful 
time for the real amateur of Paris and the country around, which 
is full of charming corners where one can dine at quiet little 
restaurants, overhanging the water or buried among trees.&nbsp; 
You are sure of getting the best of attention from the waiters, 
and the dishes you order receive all the cook&rsquo;s 
attention.&nbsp; Of an evening the Bois is alive with a myriad of
bicycles, their lights twinkling among the trees like 
many-colored fire-flies.&nbsp; To any one who knows how to live 
there, Paris is at its best in the last half of June and 
July.&nbsp; Nevertheless, in a couple of days there will not be 
an American in Paris, London being the objective point; for we 
love to be &ldquo;in at the death,&rdquo; and a coronation, a 
musical festival, or a big race is sure to attract all our 
floating population.</p>
<p>The Americans who have the hardest time in Paris are those who
try to &ldquo;run with the deer and hunt with the hounds,&rdquo; 
as the French proverb has it, who would fain serve God and 
Mammon.&nbsp; As anything especially amusing is sure to take 
place on Sunday in this wicked capital, our friends go through 
agonies of indecision, their consciences pulling one way, their 
desire to amuse themselves the other.&nbsp; Some find a middle 
course, it seems, for yesterday this conversation was overheard 
on the steps of the American Church:</p>
<p><i>First American Lady</i>: &ldquo;Are you going to stop for 
the sermon?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Second American Lady</i>: &ldquo;I am so sorry I 
can&rsquo;t, but the races begin at one!&rdquo;</p>
<h2>No. 20&mdash;&ldquo;The Treadmill.&rdquo;</h2>
<p>A half-humorous, half-pathetic epistle has been sent to me by 
a woman, who explains in it her particular perplexity.&nbsp; Such
letters are the windfalls of our profession!&nbsp; For what is 
more attractive than to have a woman take you for her lay 
confessor, to whom she comes for advice in trouble? opening her 
innocent heart for your inspection!</p>
<p>My correspondent complains that her days are not sufficiently 
long, nor is her strength great enough, for the thousand and one 
duties and obligations imposed upon her.&nbsp; &ldquo;If,&rdquo; 
she says, &ldquo;a woman has friends and a small place in the 
world&mdash;and who has not in these days?&mdash;she must golf or
&lsquo;bike&rsquo; or skate a bit, of a morning; then she is apt 
to lunch out, or have a friend or two in, to that meal.&nbsp; 
After luncheon there is sure to be a &lsquo;class&rsquo; of some 
kind that she has foolishly joined, or a charity meeting, 
matin&eacute;e, or reception; but above all, there are her 
&lsquo;duty&rsquo; calls.&nbsp; She must be home at five to make 
tea, that she has promised her men friends, and they will not 
leave until it is time for her to dress for dinner, 
&lsquo;out&rsquo; or at home, with often the opera, a supper, or 
a ball to follow.&nbsp; It is quite impossible,&rdquo; she adds, 
&ldquo;under these circumstances to apply one&rsquo;s self to 
anything serious, to read a book or even open a periodical.&nbsp;
The most one can accomplish is a glance at a paper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Indeed, it would require an exceptional constitution to carry 
out the above programme, not to mention the attention that a 
woman must (however reluctantly) give to her house and her 
family.&nbsp; Where are the quiet hours to be found for 
self-culture, the perusal of a favorite author, or, perhaps, a 
little timid &ldquo;writing&rdquo; on her own account?&nbsp; Nor 
does this treadmill round fill a few months only of her 
life.&nbsp; With slight variations of scene and costume, it 
continues through the year.</p>
<p>A painter, I know, was fortunate enough to receive, a year or 
two ago, the commission to paint a well-known beauty.&nbsp; He 
was delighted with the idea and convinced that he could make her 
portrait the best work of his life, one that would be the 
stepping-stone to fame and fortune.&nbsp; This was in the 
spring.&nbsp; He was naturally burning to begin at once, but 
found to his dismay that the lady was just about starting for 
Europe.&nbsp; So he waited, and at her suggestion installed 
himself a couple of months later at the seaside city where she 
had a cottage.&nbsp; No one could be more charming than she was, 
inviting him to dine and drive daily, but when he broached the 
subject of &ldquo;sitting,&rdquo; was &ldquo;too busy just that 
day.&rdquo;&nbsp; Later in the autumn she would be quite at his 
disposal.&nbsp; In the autumn, however, she was visiting, never 
ten days in the same place.&nbsp; Early winter found her 
&ldquo;getting her house in order,&rdquo; a mysterious rite 
apparently attended with vast worry and fatigue.&nbsp; With 
cooling enthusiasm, the painter called and coaxed and 
waited.&nbsp; November brought the opera and the full swing of a 
New York season.&nbsp; So far she has given him half a dozen 
sittings, squeezed in between a luncheon, which made her 
&ldquo;unavoidably late,&rdquo; for which she is charmingly 
&ldquo;sorry,&rdquo; and a reception that she was forced to 
attend, although &ldquo;it breaks my heart to leave just as you 
are beginning to work so well, but I really must, or the tiresome
old cat who is giving the tea will be saying all sorts of 
unpleasant things about me.&rdquo;&nbsp; So she flits off, 
leaving the poor, disillusioned painter before his canvas, 
knowing now that his dream is over, that in a month or two his 
pretty sitter will be off again to New Orleans for the carnival, 
or abroad, and that his weary round of waiting will 
recommence.&nbsp; He will be fortunate if some day it does not 
float back to him, in the mysterious way disagreeable things do 
come to one, that she has been heard to say, &ldquo;I fear dear 
Mr. Palette is not very clever, for I have been sitting to him 
for over a year, and he has really done nothing yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He has been simply the victim of a state of affairs that 
neither of them were strong enough to break through.&nbsp; It 
never entered into Beauty&rsquo;s head that she could lead a life
different from her friends.&nbsp; She was honestly anxious to 
have a successful portrait of herself, but the sacrifice of any 
of her habits was more than she could make.</p>
<p>Who among my readers (and I am tempted to believe they are all
more sensible than the above young woman) has not, during a 
summer passed with agreeable friends, made a thousand pleasant 
little plans with them for the ensuing winter,&mdash;the books 
they were to read at the same time, the &ldquo;exhibitions&rdquo;
they were to see, the visits to our wonderful collections in the 
Metropolitan Museum or private galleries, cosy little dinners, 
etc.?&nbsp; And who has not found, as the winter slips away, that
few of these charming plans have been carried out?&nbsp; He and 
his friends have unconsciously fallen back into their ruts of 
former years, and the pleasant things projected have been brushed
aside by that strongest of tyrants, habit.</p>
<p>I once asked a very great lady, whose gracious manner was 
never disturbed, who floated through the endless complications of
her life with smiling serenity, how she achieved this Olympian 
calm.&nbsp; She was good enough to explain.&nbsp; &ldquo;I make a
list of what I want to do each day.&nbsp; Then, as I find my day 
passing, or I get behind, or tired, I throw over every other 
engagement.&nbsp; I could have done them all with hurry and 
fatigue.&nbsp; I prefer to do one-half and enjoy what I do.&nbsp;
If I go to a house, it is to remain and appreciate whatever 
entertainment has been prepared for me.&nbsp; I never offer to 
any hostess the slight of a hurried, <i>distrait</i> 
&lsquo;call,&rsquo; with glances at my watch, and an 
&lsquo;on-the-wing&rsquo; manner.&nbsp; It is much easier not to 
go, or to send a card.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This brings me around to a subject which I believe is one of 
the causes of my correspondent&rsquo;s dilemma.&nbsp; I fear that
she never can refuse anything.&nbsp; It is a peculiar trait of 
people who go about to amuse themselves, that they are always 
sure the particular entertainment they have been asked to last is
going to &ldquo;be amusing.&rdquo;&nbsp; It rarely is different 
from the others, but these people are convinced, that to stay 
away would be to miss something.&nbsp; A weary-looking girl about
1 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> (at a house-party) when asked 
why she did not go to bed if she was so tired, answered, 
&ldquo;the nights I go to bed early, they always seem to do 
something jolly, and then I miss it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There is no greater proof of how much this weary round wears 
on women than the acts of the few who feel themselves strong 
enough in their position to defy custom.&nbsp; They have thrown 
off the yoke (at least the younger ones have) doubtless backed up
by their husbands, for men are much quicker to see the 
aimlessness of this stupid social routine.&nbsp; First they broke
down the great New-Year-call &ldquo;grind.&rdquo;&nbsp; Men over 
forty doubtless recall with a shudder, that awful custom which 
compelled a man to get into his dress clothes at ten <span 
class="smcap">a.m.</span>, and pass his day rushing about from 
house to house like a postman.&nbsp; Out-of-town clubs and sport 
helped to do away with that remnant of New Amsterdam.&nbsp; Next 
came the male revolt from the afternoon &ldquo;tea&rdquo; or 
&ldquo;musical.&rdquo;&nbsp; A black coat is rare now at either 
of these functions, or if seen is pretty sure to be on a back 
over fifty.&nbsp; Next, we lords of creation refused to call at 
all, or leave our cards.&nbsp; A married woman now leaves her 
husband&rsquo;s card with her own, and sisters leave the 
&ldquo;pasteboard&rdquo; of their brothers and often those of 
their brothers&rsquo; friends.&nbsp; Any combination is good 
enough to &ldquo;shoot a card.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In London the men have gone a step further.&nbsp; It is not 
uncommon to hear a young man boast that he never owned a visiting
card or made a &ldquo;duty&rdquo; call in his life.&nbsp; Neither
there nor with us does a man count as a &ldquo;call&rdquo; a 
quiet cup of tea with a woman he likes, and a cigarette and quiet
talk until dressing time.&nbsp; Let the young women have courage 
and take matters into their own hands.&nbsp; (The older ones are 
hopeless and will go on pushing this Juggernaut car over each 
other&rsquo;s weary bodies, until the end of the chapter.)&nbsp; 
Let them have the courage occasionally to &ldquo;refuse&rdquo; 
something, to keep themselves free from aimless engagements, and 
bring this paste-board war to a close.&nbsp; If a woman is 
attractive, she will be asked out all the same, never fear!&nbsp;
If she is not popular, the few dozen of &ldquo;egg-shell 
extra&rdquo; that she can manage to slip in at the front doors of
her acquaintances will not help her much.</p>
<p>If this matter is, however, so vastly important in 
women&rsquo;s eyes, why not adopt the continental and diplomatic 
custom and send cards by post or otherwise?&nbsp; There, if a 
new-comer dines out and meets twenty-five people for the first 
time, cards must be left the next day at their twenty-five 
respective residences.&nbsp; How the cards get there is of no 
importance.&nbsp; It is a diplomatic fiction that the new 
acquaintance has called in person, and the call will be returned 
within twenty-four hours.&nbsp; Think of the saving of time and 
strength!&nbsp; In Paris, on New Year&rsquo;s Day, people send 
cards by post to everybody they wish to keep up.&nbsp; That does 
for a year, and no more is thought about it.&nbsp; All the time 
thus gained can be given to culture or recreation.</p>
<p>I have often wondered why one sees so few women one knows at 
our picture exhibitions or flower shows.&nbsp; It is no longer a 
mystery to me.&nbsp; They are all busy trotting up and down our 
long side streets leaving cards.&nbsp; Hideous vision!&nbsp; 
Should Dante by any chance reincarnate, he would find here the 
material ready made to his hand for an eighth circle in his 
<i>Inferno</i>.</p>
<h2>No. 21&mdash;&ldquo;Like Master Like Man.&rdquo;</h2>
<p>A frequent and na&iuml;ve complaint one hears, is of the 
unsatisfactoriness of servants generally, and their ingratitude 
and astonishing lack of affection for their masters, in 
particular.&nbsp; &ldquo;After all I have done for them,&rdquo; 
is pretty sure to sum up the long tale of a housewife&rsquo;s 
griefs.&nbsp; Of all the delightful inconsistencies that grace 
the female mind, this latter point of view always strikes me as 
being the most complete.&nbsp; I artfully lead my fair friend on 
to tell me all about her woes, and she is sure to be exquisitely 
one-sided and quite unconscious of her position.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;They are so extravagant, take so little interest in my 
things, and leave me at a moment&rsquo;s notice, if they get an 
idea I am going to break up.&nbsp; Horrid things!&nbsp; I wish I 
could do without them!&nbsp; They cause me endless worry and 
annoyance.&rdquo;&nbsp; My friend is very nearly right,&mdash;but
with whom lies the fault?</p>
<p>The conditions were bad enough years ago, when servants were 
kept for decades in the same family, descending like heirlooms 
from father to son, often (abroad) being the foster sisters or 
brothers of their masters, and bound to the household by an 
hundred ties of sympathy and tradition.&nbsp; But in our day, and
in America, where there is rarely even a common language or 
nationality to form a bond, and where households are broken up 
with such facility, the relation between master and servant is 
often so strained and so unpleasant that we risk becoming (what 
foreigners reproach us with being), a nation of 
hotel-dwellers.&nbsp; Nor is this class-feeling greatly to be 
wondered at.&nbsp; The contrary would be astonishing.&nbsp; From 
the primitive household, where a poor neighbor comes in as 
&ldquo;help,&rdquo; to the &ldquo;great&rdquo; establishment 
where the butler and housekeeper eat apart, and a group of 
plush-clad flunkies imported from England adorn the 
entrance-hall, nothing could be better contrived to set one class
against another than domestic service.</p>
<p>Proverbs have grown out of it in every language.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;No man is a hero to his valet,&rdquo; and 
&ldquo;familiarity breeds contempt,&rdquo; are clear 
enough.&nbsp; Our comic papers are full of the misunderstandings 
and absurdities of the situation, while one rarely sees a joke 
made about the other ways that the poor earn their living.&nbsp; 
Think of it for a moment!&nbsp; To be obliged to attend people at
the times of day when they are least attractive, when from 
fatigue or temper they drop the mask that society glues to their 
faces so many hours in the twenty-four; to see always the seamy 
side of life, the small expedients, the aids to nature; to stand 
behind a chair and hear an acquaintance of your master&rsquo;s 
ridiculed, who has just been warmly praised to his face; to see a
hostess who has been graciously urging her guests &ldquo;not to 
go so soon,&rdquo; blurt out all her boredom and thankfulness 
&ldquo;that those tiresome So-and-So&rsquo;s&rdquo; are 
&ldquo;paid off at last,&rdquo; as soon as the door is closed 
behind them, must needs give a curious bent to a servant&rsquo;s 
mind.&nbsp; They see their employers insincere, and copy 
them.&nbsp; Many a mistress who has been smilingly assured by her
maid how much her dress becomes her, and how young she is 
looking, would be thunderstruck to hear herself laughed at and 
criticised (none too delicately) five minutes later in that 
servant&rsquo;s talk.</p>
<p>Servants are trained from their youth up to conceal their true
feelings.&nbsp; A domestic who said what she thought would 
quickly lose her place.&nbsp; Frankly, is it not asking a good 
deal to expect a maid to be very fond of a lady who makes her sit
up night after night until the small hours to unlace her bodice 
or take down her hair; or imagine a valet can be devoted to a 
master he has to get into bed as best he can because he is too 
tipsy to get there unaided?&nbsp; Immortal &ldquo;Figaro&rdquo; 
is the type!&nbsp; Supple, liar, corrupt, intelligent,&mdash;he 
aids his master and laughs at him, feathering his own nest the 
while.&nbsp; There is a saying that &ldquo;horses corrupt whoever
lives with them.&rdquo;&nbsp; It would be more correct to say 
that domestic service demoralizes alike both master and man.</p>
<p>Already we are obliged to depend on immigration for our 
servants because an American revolts from the false position, 
though he willingly accepts longer hours or harder work where he 
has no one around him but his equals.&nbsp; It is the old story 
of the free, hungry wolf, and the well-fed, but chained, 
house-dog.&nbsp; The foreigners that immigration now brings us, 
from countries where great class distinctions exist, find it 
natural to &ldquo;serve.&rdquo;&nbsp; With the increase in 
education and consequent self-respect, the difficulty of getting 
efficient and contented servants will increase with us.&nbsp; It 
has already become a great social problem in England.&nbsp; The 
trouble lies beneath the surface.&nbsp; If a superior class 
accept service at all, it is with the intention of quickly 
getting money enough to do something better.&nbsp; With them 
service is merely the means to an end.&nbsp; A first step on the 
ladder!</p>
<p>Bad masters are the cause of so much suffering, that to 
protect themselves, the great brother-hood of servants have 
imagined a system of keeping run of &ldquo;places,&rdquo; and 
giving them a &ldquo;character&rdquo; which an aspirant can find 
out with little trouble.&nbsp; This organization is so complete, 
and so well carried out, that a household where the lady has a 
&ldquo;temper,&rdquo; where the food is poor, or which breaks up 
often, can rarely get a first-class domestic.&nbsp; The 
&ldquo;place&rdquo; has been boycotted, a good servant will 
sooner remain idle than enter it.&nbsp; If circumstances are too 
much for him and he accepts the situation, it is with his eyes 
open, knowing infinitely more about his new employers and their 
failings than they dream of, or than they could possibly find out
about him.</p>
<p>One thing never can be sufficiently impressed on people, viz.:
that we are forced to live with detectives, always behind us in 
caps or dress-suits, ready to note every careless word, every 
incautious criticism of friend or acquaintance&mdash;their money 
matters or their love affairs&mdash;and who have nothing more 
interesting to do than to repeat what they have heard, with 
embroideries and additions of their own.&nbsp; Considering this, 
and that nine people out of ten talk quite oblivious of their 
servants&rsquo; presence, it is to be wondered at that so little 
(and not that so much) trouble is made.</p>
<p>It always amuses me when I ask a friend if she is going abroad
in the spring, to have her say &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; with a 
frightened glance towards the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am; but I do not want the servants to know, or the 
horrid things would leave me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Poor, simple lady!&nbsp; They knew it before you did, and had 
discussed the whole matter over their &ldquo;tea&rdquo; while it 
was an almost unuttered thought in your mind.&nbsp; If they have 
not already given you notice, it is because, on the whole your 
house suits them well enough for the present, while they look 
about.&nbsp; Do not worry your simple soul, trying to keep 
anything from them.&nbsp; They know the amount of your last 
dressmaker&rsquo;s bill, and the row your husband made over 
it.&nbsp; They know how much you would have liked young 
&ldquo;Cr&oelig;sus&rdquo; for your daughter, and the little 
tricks you played to bring that marriage about.&nbsp; They know 
why you are no longer asked to dine at Mrs. Swell&rsquo;s, which 
is more than you know yourself.&nbsp; Mrs. Swell explained the 
matter to a few friends over her lunch-table recently, and the 
butler told your maid that same evening, who was laughing at the 
story as she put on your slippers!</p>
<p>Before we blame them too much, however, let us remember that 
they have it in their power to make great trouble if they 
choose.&nbsp; And considering the little that is made in this 
way, we must conclude that, on the whole, they are better than we
give them credit for being, and fill a trying situation with much
good humor and kindliness.&nbsp; The lady who is astonished that 
they take so little interest in her, will perhaps feel 
differently if she reflects how little trouble she has given 
herself to find out their anxieties and griefs, their temptations
and heart-burnings; their material situation; whom they support 
with their slowly earned wages, what claims they have on them 
from outside.&nbsp; If she will also reflect on the number of 
days in a year when she is &ldquo;not herself,&rdquo; when 
headaches or disappointments ruffle her charming temper, she may 
come to the conclusion that it is too much to expect all the 
virtues for twenty dollars a month.</p>
<p>A little more human interest, my good friends, a little more 
indulgence, and you will not risk finding yourself in the 
position of the lady who wrote me that last summer she had been 
obliged to keep open house for &ldquo;&lsquo;Cook&rsquo; 
tourists!&rdquo;</p>
<h2>No. 22&mdash;An English Invasion of the Riviera</h2>
<p>When sixty years ago Lord Brougham, <i>en route</i> for Italy,
was thrown from his travelling berline and his leg was broken, 
near the Italian hamlet of Cannes, the Riviera was as unknown to 
the polite world as the centre of China.&nbsp; The <i>grand 
tour</i> which every young aristocrat made with his tutor, on 
coming of age, only included crossing from France into Italy by 
the Alps.&nbsp; It was the occurrence of an unusually severe 
winter in Switzerland that turned Brougham aside into the longer 
and less travelled route <i>via</i> the Corniche, the marvellous 
Roman road at that time fallen into oblivion, and little used 
even by the local peasantry.</p>
<p>During the tedious weeks while his leg was mending, Lord 
Brougham amused himself by exploring the surrounding country in 
his carriage, and was quick to realize the advantages of the 
climate, and appreciate the marvellous beauty of that 
coast.&nbsp; Before the broken member was whole again, he had 
bought a tract of land and begun a villa.&nbsp; Small seed, to 
furnish such a harvest!&nbsp; To the traveller of to-day the 
Riviera offers an almost unbroken chain of beautiful residences 
from Marseilles to Genoa.</p>
<p>A Briton willingly follows where a lord leads, and Cannes 
became the centre of English fashion, a position it holds to-day 
in spite of many attractive rivals, and the defection of Victoria
who comes now to Cimiez, back of Nice, being unwilling to visit 
Cannes since the sudden death there of the Duke of Albany.&nbsp; 
A statue of Lord Brougham, the &ldquo;discoverer&rdquo; of the 
littoral, has been erected in the sunny little square at Cannes, 
and the English have in many other ways, stamped the city for 
their own.</p>
<p>No other race carry their individuality with them as they 
do.&nbsp; They can live years in a country and assimilate none of
its customs; on the contrary, imposing habits of their own.&nbsp;
It is just this that makes them such wonderful colonizers, and 
explains why you will find little groups of English people 
drinking ale and playing golf in the shade of the Pyramids or 
near the frozen slopes of Foosiyama.&nbsp; The real inwardness of
it is that they are a dull race, and, like dull people despise 
all that they do not understand.&nbsp; To differ from them is to 
be in the wrong.&nbsp; They cannot argue with you; they simply 
know, and that ends the matter.</p>
<p>I had a discussion recently with a Briton on the pronunciation
of a word.&nbsp; As there is no &ldquo;Institute,&rdquo; as in 
France, to settle matters of this kind, I maintained that we 
Americans had as much authority for our pronunciation of this 
particular word as the English.&nbsp; The answer was 
characteristic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know I am right,&rdquo; said my Island friend, 
&ldquo;because that is the way I pronounce it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Walking along the principal streets of Cannes to-day, you 
might imagine yourself (except for the climate) at Cowes or 
Brighton, so British are the shops and the crowd that passes 
them.&nbsp; Every restaurant advertises &ldquo;afternoon 
tea&rdquo; and Bass&rsquo;s ale, and every other sign bears a 
London name.&nbsp; This little matter of tea is particularly 
characteristic of the way the English have imposed a taste of 
their own on a rebellious nation.&nbsp; Nothing is further from 
the French taste than tea-drinking, and yet a Parisian lady will 
now invite you gravely to &ldquo;five o&rsquo;clocker&rdquo; with
her, although I can remember when that beverage was abhorred by 
the French as a medicine; if you had asked a Frenchman to take a 
cup of tea, he would have answered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&nbsp; I am not ill!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even Paris (that supreme and undisputed arbiter of taste) has 
submitted to English influence; tailor-made dresses and 
low-heeled shoes have become as &ldquo;good form&rdquo; in France
as in London.&nbsp; The last two Presidents of the French 
Republic have taken the oath of office dressed in frock-coats 
instead of the dress clothes to which French officials formerly 
clung as to the sacraments.</p>
<p>The municipalities of the little Southern cities were quick to
seize their golden opportunity, and everything was done to detain
the rich English wandering down towards Italy.&nbsp; Millions 
were spent in transforming their cramped, dirty, little 
towns.&nbsp; Wide boulevards bordered with palm and eucalyptus 
spread their sunny lines in all directions, being baptized 
<i>Promenade des Anglais</i> or <i>Boulevard Victoria</i>, in 
artful flattery.&nbsp; The narrow mountain roads were widened, 
casinos and theatres built and carnival <i>f&ecirc;tes</i> 
organized, the cities offering &ldquo;cups&rdquo; for yacht- or 
horse-races, and giving grounds for tennis and golf clubs.&nbsp; 
Clever Southern people!&nbsp; The money returned to them a 
hundredfold, and they lived to see their wild coast become the 
chosen residence of the wealthiest aristocracy in Europe, and the
rocky hillsides blossom into terrace above terrace of villa 
gardens, where palm and rose and geranium vie with the olive and 
the mimosa to shade the white villas from the sun.&nbsp; To-day, 
no little town on the coast is without its English chapel, 
British club, tennis ground, and golf links.&nbsp; On a fair day 
at Monte Carlo, Nice, or Cannes, the prevailing conversation is 
in English, and the handsome, well-dressed sons of Albion lounge 
along beside their astonishing womankind as thoroughly at home as
on Bond Street.</p>
<p>Those wonderful English women are the source of unending 
marvel and amusement to the French.&nbsp; They can never 
understand them, and small wonder, for with the exception of the 
small &ldquo;set&rdquo; that surrounds the Prince of Wales, who 
are dressed in the Parisian fashion, all English women seem to be
overwhelmed with regret at not being born men, and to have spent 
their time and ingenuity since, in trying to make up for 
nature&rsquo;s mistake.&nbsp; Every masculine garment is twisted 
by them to fit the female figure; their conversation, like that 
of their brothers, is about horses and dogs; their hats and 
gloves are the same as the men&rsquo;s; and when with their fine,
large feet in stout shoes they start off, with that particular 
swinging gait that makes the skirt seem superfluous, for a stroll
of twenty miles or so, Englishwomen do seem to the uninitiated to
have succeeded in their ambition of obliterating the difference 
between the sexes.</p>
<p>It is of an evening, however, when concealment is no longer 
possible, that the native taste bursts forth, the Anglo-Saxon 
standing declared in all her plainness.&nbsp; Strong is the 
contrast here, where they are placed side by side with all that 
Europe holds of elegant, and well-dressed Frenchwomen, whether of
the &ldquo;world&rdquo; or the &ldquo;half-world,&rdquo; are 
invariably marvels of fitness and freshness, the simplest 
materials being converted by their skilful touch into toilettes, 
so artfully adapted to the wearer&rsquo;s figure and complexion, 
as to raise such &ldquo;creations&rdquo; to the level of a fine 
art.</p>
<p>An artist feels, he must fix on canvas that particular 
combination of colors or that wonderful line of bust and 
hip.&nbsp; It is with a shudder that he turns to the British 
matron, for she has probably, for this occasion, draped herself 
in an &ldquo;art material,&rdquo;&mdash;principally 
&ldquo;Liberty&rdquo; silks of dirty greens and blues 
(&aelig;sthetic shades!).&nbsp; He is tempted to cry out in his 
disgust: &ldquo;Oh, Liberty!&nbsp; Liberty!&nbsp; How many crimes
are committed in thy name!&rdquo;&nbsp; It is one of the oddest 
things in the world that the English should have elected to live 
so much in France, for there are probably nowhere two peoples so 
diametrically opposed on every point, or who so persistently and 
wilfully misunderstand each other, as the English and the 
French.</p>
<p>It has been my fate to live a good deal on both sides of the 
Channel, and nothing is more amusing than to hear the absurdities
that are gravely asserted by each of their neighbors.&nbsp; To a 
Briton, a Frenchman will always be &ldquo;either tiger or 
monkey&rdquo; according to Voltaire; while to the French mind 
English gravity is only hypocrisy to cover every vice.&nbsp; 
Nothing pleases him so much as a great scandal in England; he 
will gleefully bring you a paper containing the account of it, to
prove how true is his opinion.&nbsp; It is quite useless to 
explain to the British mind, as I have often tried to do, that 
all Frenchmen do not pass their lives drinking absinthe on the 
boulevards; and as Englishmen seem to leave their morals in a 
valise at Dover when off for a visit to Paris, to be picked up on
their return, it is time lost to try to make a Gaul understand 
what good husbands and fathers the sons of Albion are.</p>
<p>These two great nations seem to stand in the relation to each 
other that Rome and Greece held.&nbsp; The English are the 
conquerors of the world, and its great colonizers; with a vast 
capital in which wealth and misery jostle each other on the 
streets; a hideous conglomeration of buildings and monuments, 
without form and void, very much as old Rome must have been under
the C&aelig;sars, enormous buildings without taste, and enormous 
wealth.&nbsp; The French have inherited the temperament of the 
Greeks.&nbsp; The drama, painting, and sculpture are the 
preoccupation of the people.&nbsp; The yearly exhibitions are, 
for a month before they open, the unique subject of conversation 
in drawing-room or club.&nbsp; The state protects the artist and 
buys his work.&nbsp; Their <i>conservatoires</i> form the 
singers, and their schools the painters and architects of Europe 
and America.</p>
<p>The English copy them in their big way, just as the Romans 
copied the masterpieces of Greek art, while they despised the 
authors.&nbsp; It is rare that a play succeeds in Paris which is 
not instantly translated and produced in London, often with the 
adapter&rsquo;s name printed on the programme in place of the 
author&rsquo;s, the Frenchman, who only wrote it, being 
ignored.&nbsp; Just as the Greeks faded away and disappeared 
before their Roman conquerors, it is to be feared that in our day
this people of a finer clay will succumb.&nbsp; The 
&ldquo;defects of their qualities&rdquo; will be their 
ruin.&nbsp; They will stop at home, occupied with literature and 
art, perfecting their dainty cities; while their tougher 
neighbors are dominating the globe, imposing their language and 
customs on the conquered peoples or the earth.&nbsp; One feels 
this on the Riviera.&nbsp; It reminds you of the cuckoo who, once
installed in a robin&rsquo;s nest, that seems to him convenient 
and warmly located in the sunshine, ends by kicking out all the 
young robins.</p>
<h2>No. 23&mdash;A Common Weakness</h2>
<p>Governments may change and all the conditions of life be 
modified, but certain ambitions and needs of man remain 
immutable.&nbsp; Climates, customs, centuries, have in no way 
diminished the craving for consideration, the desire to be 
somebody, to bear some mark indicating to the world that one is 
not as other men.</p>
<p>For centuries titles supplied the want.&nbsp; This 
satisfaction has been denied to us, so ambitious souls are 
obliged to seek other means to feed their vanity.</p>
<p>Even before we were born into the world of nations, an attempt
was made amongst the aristocratically minded court surrounding 
our chief magistrate, to form a society that should (without the 
name) be the beginning of a class apart.</p>
<p>The order of the Cincinnati was to have been the nucleus of an
American nobility.&nbsp; The tendencies of this society are 
revealed by the fact that primogeniture was its fundamental 
law.&nbsp; Nothing could have been more opposed to the spirit of 
the age, nor more at variance with the declaration of our 
independence, than the insertion of such a clause.&nbsp; This 
fact was discovered by the far-seeing eye of Washington, and the 
society was suppressed in the hope (shared by almost all 
contemporaries) that with new forms of government the nature of 
man would undergo a transformation and rise above such puerile 
ambitions.</p>
<p>Time has shown the fallacy of these dreams.&nbsp; All that has
been accomplished is the displacement of the objective point; the
desire, the mania for a handle to one&rsquo;s name is as 
prevalent as ever.&nbsp; Leave the centres of civilization and 
wander in the small towns and villages of our country.&nbsp; 
Every other man you meet is introduced as the Colonel or the 
Judge, and you will do well not to inquire too closely into the 
matter, nor to ask to see the title-deeds to such 
distinctions.&nbsp; On the other hand, to omit his prefix in 
addressing one of these local magnates, would be to offend him 
deeply.&nbsp; The women-folk were quick to borrow a little of 
this distinction, and in Washington to-day one is gravely 
presented to Mrs. Senator Smith or Mrs. Colonel Jones.&nbsp; The 
climax being reached by one aspiring female who styles herself on
her visiting cards, &ldquo;Mrs. Acting-Assistant-Paymaster 
Robinson.&rdquo;&nbsp; If by any chance it should occur to any 
one to ask her motive in sporting such an unwieldy handle, she 
would say that she did it &ldquo;because one can&rsquo;t be going
about explaining that one is not just ordinary Mrs. Robinson or 
Thompson, like the thousand others in town.&rdquo;&nbsp; A woman 
who cannot find an excuse for assuming such a prefix will 
sometime have recourse to another stratagem, to particularize an 
ordinary surname.&nbsp; She remembers that her husband, who ever 
since he was born has been known to everybody as Jim, is the 
proud possessor of the middle name Ivanhoe, or Pericles (probably
the result of a romantic mother&rsquo;s reading); so one fine day
the young couple bloom out as Mr. and Mrs. J. Pericles Sparks, to
the amusement of their friends, their own satisfaction, and the 
hopeless confusion of their tradespeople.</p>
<p>Not long ago a Westerner, who went abroad with a travelling 
show, was received with enthusiasm in England because it was 
thought &ldquo;The Honorable&rdquo; which preceded his name on 
his cards implied that although an American he was somehow the 
son of an earl.&nbsp; As a matter of fact he owed this title to 
having sat, many years before in the Senate of a far-western 
State.&nbsp; He will cling to that &ldquo;Honorable&rdquo; and 
print it on his cards while life lasts.&nbsp; I was told the 
other day of an American carpet warrior who appeared at court 
function abroad decorated with every college badge, and football 
medal in his possession, to which he added at the last moment a 
brass trunk check, to complete the brilliancy of the 
effect.&nbsp; This latter decoration attracted the attention of 
the Heir Apparent, who inquired the meaning of the mystic 
&ldquo;416&rdquo; upon it.&nbsp; This would have been a 
&ldquo;facer&rdquo; to any but a true son of Uncle Sam.&nbsp; 
Nothing daunted, however, our &ldquo;General&rdquo; replied 
&ldquo;That, Sir, is the number of pitched battles I have 
won.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I have my doubts as to the absolute veracity of this 
tale.&nbsp; But that the son of one of our generals, appeared not
long ago at a public reception abroad, wearing his father&rsquo;s
medals and decorations, is said to be true.&nbsp; Decorations on 
the Continent are official badges of distinction conferred and 
recognized by the different governments.&nbsp; An American who 
wears, out of his own country, an army or college badge which has
no official existence, properly speaking, being recognized by no 
government, but which is made intentionally to look as much as 
possible like the &ldquo;L&eacute;gion d&rsquo;Honneur,&rdquo; is
deliberately imposing on the ignorance of foreigners, and is but 
little less of a pretentious idiot than the owners of the trunk 
check and the borrowed decorations.</p>
<p>There seems no end to the ways a little ambitious game can be 
played.&nbsp; One device much in favor is for the wife to attach 
her own family name to that of her husband by means of a 
hyphen.&nbsp; By this arrangement she does not entirely lose her 
individuality; as a result we have a splendid assortment of 
hybrid names, such as Van Cortland-Smith and Beekman-Brown.&nbsp;
Be they never so incongruous these double-barrelled cognomens 
serve their purpose and raise ambitious mortals above the level 
of other Smiths and Browns.&nbsp; Finding that this arrangement 
works well in their own case, it is passed on to the next 
generation.&nbsp; There are no more Toms and Bills in these 
aspiring days.&nbsp; The little boys are all Cadwalladers or 
Carrolls.&nbsp; Their school-fellows, however, work sad havoc 
with these high-sounding titles and quickly abbreviate them into 
humble &ldquo;Cad&rdquo; or &ldquo;Rol.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is surprising to notice what a number of middle-aged 
gentlemen have blossomed out of late with decorations in their 
button-holes according to the foreign fashion.&nbsp; On inquiry I
have discovered that these ornaments designate members of the 
G.A.R., the Loyal Legion, or some local Post, for the rosettes 
differ in form and color.&nbsp; When these gentlemen travel 
abroad, to reduce their waists or improve their minds, the 
effects on the hotel waiters and cabmen must be immense.&nbsp; 
They will be charged three times the ordinary tariff instead of 
only the double which is the stranger&rsquo;s usual fate at the 
hands of simple-minded foreigners.&nbsp; The satisfaction must be
cheap, however, at that price.</p>
<p>Even our wise men and sages do not seem to have escaped the 
contagion.&nbsp; One sees professors and clergymen (who ought to 
set a better example) trailing half a dozen letters after their 
names, initials which to the initiated doubtless mean something, 
but which are also intended to fill the souls of the ignorant 
with envy.&nbsp; I can recall but one case of a foreign 
decoration being refused by a compatriot.&nbsp; He was a genius 
and we all know that geniuses are crazy.&nbsp; This gentleman had
done something particularly gratifying to an Eastern potentate, 
who in return offered him one of his second-best orders.&nbsp; It
was at once refused.&nbsp; When urged on him a second time our 
countryman lost his temper and answered, &ldquo;If you want to 
give it to somebody, present it to my valet.&nbsp; He is most 
anxious to be decorated.&rdquo;&nbsp; And it was done!</p>
<p>It does not require a deeply meditative mind to discover the 
motives of ambitious struggles.&nbsp; The first and strongest 
illusion of the human mind is to believe that we are different 
from our fellows, and our natural impulse is to try and impress 
this belief upon others.</p>
<p>Pride of birth is but one of the manifestations of the 
universal weakness&mdash;invariably taking stronger and stronger 
hold of the people, who from the modest dimension of their 
income, or other untoward circumstances, can find no outward and 
visible form with which to dazzle the world.&nbsp; You will find 
that a desire to shine is the secret of most of the tips and 
presents that are given while travelling or visiting, for they 
can hardly be attributed to pure spontaneous generosity.</p>
<p>How many people does one meet who talk of their poor and 
unsuccessful relatives while omitting to mention rich and 
powerful connections?&nbsp; We are told that far from blaming 
such a tendency we are to admire it.&nbsp; That it is proper 
pride to put one&rsquo;s best foot forward and keep an offending 
member well out of sight, that the man who wears a rosette in the
button-hole of his coat and has half the alphabet galloping after
his name, is an honor to his family.</p>
<p>Far be it from me to deride this weakness in others, for in my
heart I am persuaded that if I lived in China, nothing would 
please me more than to have my cap adorned with a coral button, 
while if fate had cast my life in the pleasant places of central 
Africa, a ring in my nose would doubtless have filled my soul 
with joy.&nbsp; The fact that I share this weakness does not, 
however, prevent my laughing at such folly in others.</p>
<h2>No. 24&mdash;Changing Paris</h2>
<p>Paris is beginning to show signs of the coming 
&ldquo;Exhibition of 1900,&rdquo; and is in many ways going 
through a curious stage of transformation, socially as well as 
materially.&nbsp; The <i>Palais De l&rsquo;Industrie</i>, 
familiar to all visitors here, as the home of the <i>Salons</i>, 
the Horse Shows, and a thousand gay <i>f&ecirc;tes</i> and 
merry-makings, is being torn down to make way for the new avenue 
leading, with the bridge Alexander III., from the Champs 
Elys&eacute;es to the Esplanade des Invalides.&nbsp; This 
thoroughfare with the gilded dome of Napoleon&rsquo;s tomb to 
close its perspective is intended to be the feature of the coming
&ldquo;show.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Curious irony of things in this world!&nbsp; The <i>Palais De 
l&rsquo;Industrie</i> was intended to be the one permanent 
building of the exhibition of 1854.&nbsp; An old 
&ldquo;Journal&rdquo; I often read tells how the writer saw the 
long line of gilded coaches (borrowed from Versailles for the 
occasion), eight horses apiece, led by footmen&mdash;horses and 
men blazing in embroidered trappings&mdash;leave the Tuileries 
and proceed at a walk to the great gateway of the now 
disappearing palace.&nbsp; Victoria and Albert who were on an 
official visit to the Emperor were the first to alight; then 
Eug&eacute;nie in the radiance of her perfect beauty stepped from
the coach (sad omen!) that fifty years before had taken Josephine
in tears to Malmaison.</p>
<p>It may interest some ladies to know how an Empress was dressed
on that spring morning forty-four years ago.&nbsp; She wore 
rose-colored silk with an over-dress (I think that is what it is 
called) of black lace flounces, immense hoops, and a black 
<i>Chantilly</i> lace shawl.&nbsp; Her hair, a brilliant golden 
auburn, was dressed low on the temples, covering the ears, and 
hung down her back in a gold net almost to her waist; at the 
extreme back of her head was placed a black and rose-colored 
bonnet; open &ldquo;flowing&rdquo; sleeves showed her bare arms, 
one-buttoned, straw-colored gloves, and ruby bracelets; she 
carried a tiny rose-colored parasol not a foot in diameter.</p>
<p>How England&rsquo;s great sovereign was dressed the writer of 
the journal does not so well remember, for in those days 
Eug&eacute;nie was the cynosure of all eyes, and people rarely 
looked at anything else when they could get a glimpse of her 
lovely face.</p>
<p>It appears, however, that the Queen sported an India shawl, 
hoops, and a green bonnet, which was not particularly becoming to
her red face.&nbsp; She and Napoleon entered the building first; 
the Empress (who was in delicate health) was carried in an open 
chair, with Prince Albert walking at her side, a marvellously 
handsome couple to follow the two dowdy little sovereigns who 
preceded them.&nbsp; The writer had by bribery succeeded in 
getting places in an <i>entresol</i> window under the archway, 
and was greatly impressed to see those four great ones laughing 
and joking together over Eug&eacute;nie&rsquo;s trouble in 
getting her hoops into the narrow chair!</p>
<p>What changes have come to that laughing group!&nbsp; Two are 
dead, one dying in exile and disgrace; and it would be hard to 
find in the two rheumatic old ladies whom one sees pottering 
about the Riviera now, any trace of those smiling wives.&nbsp; In
France it is as if a tidal wave had swept over Napoleon&rsquo;s 
court.&nbsp; Only the old palace stood severely back from the 
Champs Elys&eacute;es, as if guarding its souvenirs.&nbsp; The 
pick of the mason has brought down the proud gateway which its 
imperial builder fondly imagined was to last for ages.&nbsp; The 
Tuileries preceded it into oblivion.&nbsp; The Alpha and Omega of
that gorgeous pageant of the fifties vanished like a mirage!</p>
<p>It is not here alone one finds Paris changing.&nbsp; A railway
is being brought along the quais with its d&eacute;p&ocirc;t at 
the Invalides.&nbsp; Another is to find its terminus opposite the
Louvre, where the picturesque ruin of the Cour des Comptes has 
stood half-hidden by the trees since 1870.&nbsp; A line of 
electric cars crosses the Rond Point, in spite of the opposition 
of all the neighborhood, anxious to keep, at least that fine 
perspective free from such desecration.&nbsp; And, last but not 
least, there is every prospect of an immense system of elevated 
railways being inaugurated in connection with the coming 
world&rsquo;s fair.&nbsp; The direction of this kind of 
improvement is entirely in the hands of the Municipal Council, 
and that body has become (here in Paris) extremely radical, not 
to say communistic; and takes pleasure in annoying the 
inhabitants of the richer quarters of the city, under pretext of 
improvements and facilities of circulation.</p>
<p>It is easy to see how strong the feeling is against the 
aristocratic class.&nbsp; Nor is it much to be wondered at!&nbsp;
The aristocracy seem to try to make themselves unpopular.&nbsp; 
They detest the republic, which has shorn them of their splendor,
and do everything in their power (socially and diplomatically 
their power is still great) to interfere with and frustrate the 
plans of the government.&nbsp; Only last year they seized an 
opportunity at the funerals of the Duchesse 
d&rsquo;Alen&ccedil;on and the Duc d&rsquo;Aumale to make a 
royalist manifestation of the most pronounced character.&nbsp; 
The young Duchesse d&rsquo;Orleans was publicly spoken of and 
treated as the &ldquo;Queen of France;&rdquo; at the private 
receptions given during her stay in Paris the same ceremonial was
observed as if she had been really on the throne.&nbsp; The young
Duke, her husband, was not present, being in exile as a 
pretender, but armorial bearings of the &ldquo;reigning 
family,&rdquo; as their followers insist on calling them, were 
hung around the Madeleine and on the funeral-cars of both the 
illustrious dead.</p>
<p>The government is singularly lenient to the aristocrats.&nbsp;
If a poor man cries &ldquo;Long live the Commune!&rdquo; in the 
street, he is arrested.&nbsp; The police, however, stood quietly 
by and let a group of the old nobility shout &ldquo;Long live the
Queen!&rdquo; as the train containing the young Duchesse 
d&rsquo;Orleans moved out of the station.&nbsp; The secret of 
this leniency toward the &ldquo;pretenders&rdquo; to the throne, 
is that they are very little feared.&nbsp; If it amuses a set of 
wealthy people to play at holding a court, the strong government 
of the republic cares not one jot.&nbsp; The Orleans family have 
never been popular in France, and the young pretender&rsquo;s 
marriage to an Austrian Archduchess last year has not improved 
matters.</p>
<p>It is the fashion in the conservative Faubourg St. Germain, to
ridicule the President, his wife and their bourgeois 
surroundings, as forty years ago the parents of these aristocrats
affected to despise the imperial <i>parvenus</i>.&nbsp; The 
swells amused themselves during the official visit of the Emperor
and Empress of Russia last year (which was gall and wormwood to 
them) by exaggerating and repeating all the small slips in 
etiquette that the President, an intelligent, but simple-mannered
gentleman, was supposed to have made during the sojourn of his 
imperial guests.</p>
<p>Both M. and Mme. Faure are extremely popular with the people, 
and are heartily cheered whenever they are seen in public.&nbsp; 
The President is the despair of the lovers of routine and 
etiquette, walking in and out of his Palais of the Elys&eacute;e,
like a private individual, and breaking all rules and 
regulations.&nbsp; He is fond of riding, and jogs off to the Bois
of a morning with no escort, and often of an evening drops in at 
the theatres in a casual way.&nbsp; The other night at the 
Fran&ccedil;ais he suddenly appeared in the <i>foyer des 
artistes</i> (a beautiful greenroom, hung with historical 
portraits of great actors and actresses, one of the prides of the
theatre) in this informal manner.&nbsp; Mme. Bartet, who happened
to be there alone at the time, was so impressed at such an 
unprecedented event that she fainted, and the President had to 
run for water and help revive her.&nbsp; The next day he sent the
great actress a beautiful vase of S&egrave;vres china, full of 
water, in souvenir.</p>
<p>To a lover of old things and old ways any changes in the Paris
he has known and loved are a sad trial.&nbsp; Henri Drumont, in 
his delightful <i>Mon Vieux Paris</i>, deplores this modern mania
for reform which has done such good work in the new quarters but 
should, he thinks, respect the historic streets and shady 
squares.</p>
<p>One naturally feels that the sights familiar in youth lose by 
being transformed and doubts the necessity of such 
improvements.</p>
<p>The Rome of my childhood is no more!&nbsp; Half of Cairo was 
ruthlessly transformed in sixty-five into a hideous caricature of
modern Paris.&nbsp; Milan has been remodelled, each city losing 
in charm as it gained in convenience.</p>
<p>So far Paris has held her own.&nbsp; The spirit of the city 
has not been lost, as in the other capitals.&nbsp; The fair 
metropolis of France, in spite of many transformations, still 
holds her admirers with a dominating sway.&nbsp; She pours out 
for them a strong elixir that once tasted takes the flavor out of
existence in other cities and makes her adorers, when in exile, 
thirst for another draught of the subtle nectar.</p>
<h2>No. 25&mdash;Contentment</h2>
<p>As the result of certain ideal standards adopted among us when
this country was still in long clothes, a time when the equality 
of man was the new &ldquo;fad&rdquo; of many nations, and the 
prizes of life first came within the reach of those fortunate or 
unscrupulous enough to seize them, it became the fashion (and has
remained so down to our day) to teach every little boy attending 
a village school to look upon himself as a possible future 
President, and to assume that every girl was preparing herself 
for the position of first lady in the land.&nbsp; This is very 
well in theory, and practice has shown that, as Napoleon said, 
&ldquo;Every private may carry a marshal&rsquo;s baton in his 
knapsack.&rdquo;&nbsp; Alongside of the good such incentive may 
produce, it is only fair, however, to consider also how much harm
may lie in this way of presenting life to a child&rsquo;s 
mind.</p>
<p>As a first result of such tall talking we find in America, 
more than in any other country, an inclination among all classes 
to leave the surroundings where they were born and bend their 
energies to struggling out of the position in life occupied by 
their parents.&nbsp; There are not wanting theorists who hold 
that this is a quality in a nation, and that it leads to great 
results.&nbsp; A proposition open to discussion.</p>
<p>It is doubtless satisfactory to designate first magistrates 
who have raised themselves from humble beginnings to that proud 
position, and there are times when it is proper to recall such 
achievements to the rising generation.&nbsp; But as youth is 
proverbially over-confident it might also be well to point out, 
without danger of discouraging our sanguine youngsters, that for 
one who has succeeded, about ten million confident American 
youths, full of ambition and lofty aims, have been obliged to 
content themselves with being honest men in humble positions, 
even as their fathers before them.&nbsp; A sad humiliation, I 
grant you, for a self-respecting citizen, to end life just where 
his father did; often the case, nevertheless, in this hard world,
where so many fine qualities go unappreciated,&mdash;no societies
having as yet been formed to seek out &ldquo;mute, inglorious 
Miltons,&rdquo; and ask to crown them!</p>
<p>To descend abruptly from the sublime, to very near the 
ridiculous,&mdash;I had need last summer of a boy to go with a 
lady on a trap and help about the stable.&nbsp; So I applied to a
friend&rsquo;s coachman, a hard-working Englishman, who was 
delighted to get the place for his nephew&mdash;an American-born 
boy&mdash;the child of a sister, in great need.&nbsp; As the 
boy&rsquo;s clothes were hardly presentable, a simple livery was 
made for him; from that moment he pined, and finally announced he
was going to leave.&nbsp; In answer to my surprised inquiries, I 
discovered that a friend of his from the same tenement-house in 
which he had lived in New York had appeared in the village, and 
sooner than be seen in livery by his play-fellow he preferred 
abandoning his good place, the chance of being of aid to his 
mother, and learning an honorable way to earn his living.&nbsp; 
Remonstrances were in vain; to the wrath of his uncle, he 
departed.&nbsp; The boy had, at his school, heard so much about 
everybody being born equal and every American being a gentleman 
by right of inheritance, that he had taken himself seriously, and
despised a position his uncle was proud to hold, preferring 
elegant leisure in his native tenement-house to the humiliation 
of a livery.</p>
<p>When at college I had rooms in a neat cottage owned by an 
American family.&nbsp; The father was a butcher, as were his 
sons.&nbsp; The only daughter was exceedingly pretty.&nbsp; The 
hard-worked mother conceived high hopes for this favorite 
child.&nbsp; She was sent to a boarding-school, from which she 
returned entirely unsettled for life, having learned little 
except to be ashamed of her parents and to play on the 
piano.&nbsp; One of these instruments of torture was bought, and 
a room fitted up as a parlor for the daughter&rsquo;s use.&nbsp; 
As the family were fairly well-to-do, she was allowed to dress 
out of all keeping with her parents&rsquo; position, and, egged 
on by her mother, tried her best to marry a rich 
&ldquo;student.&rdquo;&nbsp; Failing in this, she became 
discontented, unhappy, and finally there was a scandal, this poor
victim of a false ambition going to swell the vast tide of a 
city&rsquo;s vice.&nbsp; With a sensible education, based on the 
idea that her father&rsquo;s trade was honorable and that her 
mission in life was to aid her mother in the daily work until she
might marry and go to her husband, prepared by experience to cook
his dinner and keep his house clean, and finally bring up her 
children to be honest men and women, this girl would have found a
happy future waiting for her, and have been of some good in her 
humble way.</p>
<p>It is useless to multiply illustrations.&nbsp; One has but to 
look about him in this unsettled country of ours.&nbsp; The other
day in front of my door the perennial ditch was being dug for 
some gas-pipe or other.&nbsp; Two of the gentlemen who had 
consented to do this labor wore frock-coats and top hats&mdash;or
what had once been those articles of attire&mdash;instead of 
comfortable and appropriate overalls.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Because, 
like the stable-boy, to have worn any distinctive dress would 
have been in their minds to stamp themselves as belonging to an 
inferior class, and so interfered with their chances of 
representing this country later at the Court of St. James, or 
presiding over the Senate,&mdash;positions (to judge by their 
criticism of the present incumbents) they feel no doubt as to 
their ability to fill.</p>
<p>The same spirit pervades every trade.&nbsp; The youth who 
shaves me is not a barber; he has only accepted this position 
until he has time to do something better.&nbsp; The waiter who 
brings me my chop at a down-town restaurant would resign his 
place if he were requested to shave his flowing mustache, and is 
secretly studying law.&nbsp; I lose all patience with my 
countrymen as I think over it!&nbsp; Surely we are not such a 
race of snobs as not to recognize that a good barber is more to 
be respected than a poor lawyer; that, as a French saying goes, 
<i>Il n&rsquo;y a pas de sot m&eacute;tier</i>.&nbsp; It is only 
the fool who is ashamed of his trade.</p>
<p>But enough of preaching.&nbsp; I had intended&mdash;when I 
took up my pen to-day&mdash;to write on quite another form of 
this modern folly, this eternal struggle upward into circles for 
which the struggler is fitted neither by his birth nor his 
education; the above was to have been but a preface to the matter
I had in mind, viz., &ldquo;social climbers,&rdquo; those 
scourges of modern society, the people whom no rebuffs will 
discourage and no cold shoulder chill, whose efforts have done so
much to make our countrymen a byword abroad.</p>
<p>As many philosophers teach that trouble only is positive, 
happiness being merely relative; that in any case trouble is 
pretty equally distributed among the different conditions of 
mankind; that, excepting the destitute and physically afflicted, 
all God&rsquo;s creatures have a share of joy in their lives, 
would it not be more logical, as well as more conducive to the 
general good, if a little more were done to make the young 
contented with their lot in life, instead of constantly 
suggesting to a race already prone to be unsettled, that nothing 
short of the top is worthy of an American citizen?</p>
<h2>No. 26&mdash;The Climber</h2>
<p>That form of misplaced ambition, which is the subject of the 
preceding chapter, can only be regarded seriously when it occurs 
among simple and sincere people, who, however derided, honestly 
believe that they are doing their duty to themselves and their 
families when they move heaven and earth to rise a few steps in 
the world.&nbsp; The moment we find ambition taking a purely 
social form, it becomes ridiculous.&nbsp; The aim is so paltry in
comparison with the effort, and so out of proportion with the 
energy-exerted to attain it, that one can only laugh and 
wonder!&nbsp; Unfortunately, signs of this puerile spirit 
(peculiar to the last quarter of the nineteenth century) can be 
seen on all hands and in almost every society.</p>
<p>That any man or woman should make it the unique aim and object
of existence to get into a certain &ldquo;set,&rdquo; not from 
any hope of profit or benefit, nor from the belief that it is 
composed of brilliant and amusing people, but simply because it 
passes for being exclusive and difficult of access, does at first
seem incredible.</p>
<p>That humble young painters or singers should long to know 
personally the great lights of their professions, and should 
strive to be accepted among them is easily understood, since the 
aspirants can reap but benefit, present and future, from such 
companionship.&nbsp; That a rising politician should deem it 
all-important to be on friendly terms with the 
&ldquo;bosses&rdquo; is not astonishing, for those magnates have 
it in their power to make or mar his fortune.&nbsp; But in a 
<i>milieu</i> as fluctuating as any social circle must 
necessarily be, shading off on all sides and changing as 
constantly as light on water, the end can never be considered as 
achieved or the goal attained.</p>
<p>Neither does any particular result accompany success, more 
substantial than the moral one which lies in 
self-congratulation.&nbsp; That, however, is enough for a climber
if she is bitten with the &ldquo;ascending&rdquo; madness.&nbsp; 
(I say &ldquo;she,&rdquo; because this form of ambition is more 
frequent among women, although by no means unknown to the sterner
sex.)</p>
<p>It amuses me vastly to sit in my corner and watch one of these
<i>fin-de-si&egrave;cle</i> diplomatists work out her little 
problem.&nbsp; She generally comes plunging into our city from 
outside, hot for conquest, making acquaintances right and left, 
indiscriminately; thus falling an easy prey to the wolves that 
prowl around the edges of society, waiting for just such lambs to
devour.&nbsp; Her first entertainments are worth attending for 
she has ingeniously contrived to get together all the people she 
should have left out, and failed to attract the social lights and
powers of the moment.&nbsp; If she be a quick-witted lady, she 
soon sees the error of her ways and begins a process of 
&ldquo;weeding&rdquo;&mdash;as difficult as it is unwise, each 
rejected &ldquo;weed&rdquo; instantly becoming an enemy for life,
not to speak of the risk she, in her ignorance, runs of mistaking
for &ldquo;detrimentals&rdquo; the <i>fines fleurs</i> of the 
worldly parterre.&nbsp; Ah! the way of the Climber is hard; she 
now begins to see that her path is not strewn with flowers.</p>
<p>One tactful person of this kind, whose gradual 
&ldquo;unfolding&rdquo; was watched with much amusement and 
wonder by her acquaintances, avoided all these errors by going in
early for a &ldquo;dear friend.&rdquo;&nbsp; Having, after mature
reflection, chosen her guide among the most exclusive of the 
young matrons, she proceeded quietly to pay her court <i>en 
r&egrave;gle</i>.&nbsp; Flattering little notes, boxes of candy, 
and bunches of flowers were among the forms her devotion 
took.&nbsp; As a natural result, these two ladies became 
inseparable, and the most hermetically sealed doors opened before
the new arrival.</p>
<p>A talent for music or acting is another aid.&nbsp; A few years
ago an entire family were floated into the desired haven on the 
waves of the sister&rsquo;s voice, and one young couple achieved 
success by the husband&rsquo;s aptitude for games and 
sports.&nbsp; In the latter case it was the man of the family who
did the work, dragging his wife up after him.&nbsp; A polo pony 
is hardly one&rsquo;s idea of a battle-horse, but in this case it
bore its rider on to success.</p>
<p>Once climbers have succeeded in installing themselves in the 
stronghold of their ambitions, they become more exclusive than 
their new friends ever dreamed of being, and it tries one&rsquo;s
self-restraint to hear these new arrivals deploring &ldquo;the 
levelling tendencies of the age,&rdquo; or wondering &ldquo;how 
nice people can be beginning to call on those horrid 
So-and-Sos.&nbsp; Their father sold shoes, you know.&rdquo;&nbsp;
This ultra-exclusiveness is not to be wondered at.&nbsp; The only
attraction the circle they have just entered has for the climbers
is its exclusiveness, and they do not intend that it shall lose 
its market value in their hands.&nbsp; Like Baudelaire, they 
believe that &ldquo;it is only the small number saved that makes 
the charm of Paradise.&rdquo;&nbsp; Having spent hard cash in 
this investment, they have every intention of getting their 
money&rsquo;s worth.</p>
<p>In order to give outsiders a vivid impression of the footing 
on which they stand with the great of the world, all the women 
they have just met become Nellys and Jennys, and all the men 
Dicks and Freds&mdash;behind their backs, <i>bien 
entendu</i>&mdash;for Mrs. &ldquo;Newcome&rdquo; has not yet 
reached that point of intimacy which warrants using such 
abbreviations directly to the owners.</p>
<p>Another amiable weakness common to the climber is that of 
knowing everybody.&nbsp; No name can be mentioned at home or 
abroad but Parvenu happens to be on the most intimate terms with 
the owner, and when he is conversing, great names drop out of his
mouth as plentifully as did the pearls from the pretty lips of 
the girl in the fairy story.&nbsp; All the world knows how such a
gentleman, being asked on his return from the East if he had seen
&ldquo;the Dardanelles,&rdquo; answered, &ldquo;Oh, dear, 
yes!&nbsp; I dined with them several times!&rdquo; thus settling 
satisfactorily his standing in the Orient!</p>
<p>Climbing, like every other habit, soon takes possession of the
whole nature.&nbsp; To abstain from it is torture.&nbsp; 
Napoleon, we are told, found it impossible to rest contented on 
his successes, but was impelled onward by a force stronger than 
his volition.&nbsp; In some such spirit the ambitious souls here 
referred to, after &ldquo;the Conquest of America&rdquo; and the 
discovery that the fruit of their struggles was not worth very 
much, victory having brought the inevitable satiety in its wake, 
sail away in search of new fields of adventure.&nbsp; They have 
long ago left behind the friends and acquaintances of their 
childhood.&nbsp; Relations they apparently have none, which 
accounts for the curious phenomenon that a parvenu is never in 
mourning.&nbsp; As no friendships bind them to their new circle, 
the ties are easily loosened.&nbsp; Why should they care for one 
city more than for another, unless it offer more of the sport 
they love?&nbsp; This continent has become tame, since there is 
no longer any struggle, while over the sea vast hunting grounds 
and game worthy of their powder, form an irresistible 
temptation&mdash;old and exclusive societies to be besieged, and 
contests to be waged compared to which their American experiences
are but light skirmishes.&nbsp; As the polo pony is supposed to 
pant for the fray, so the hearts of social conquerors warm within
them at the prospect of more brilliant victories.</p>
<p>The pleasure of following them on their hunting parties abroad
will have to be deferred, so vast is the subject, so full of 
thrilling adventure and, alas! also of humiliating defeat.</p>
<h2>No. 27&mdash;The Last of the Dandies</h2>
<p>So completely has the dandy disappeared from among us, that 
even the word has an old-time look (as if it had strayed out of 
some half-forgotten novel or &ldquo;keepsake&rdquo;), raising in 
our minds the picture of a slender, clean-shaven youth, in very 
tight unmentionables strapped under his feet, a dark green 
frock-coat with a collar up to the ears and a stock whose folds 
cover his chest, butter-colored gloves, and a hat&mdash;oh! a hat
that would collect a crowd in two minutes in any 
neighborhood!&nbsp; A gold-headed stick, and a quizzing glass, 
with a black ribbon an inch wide, complete the toilet.&nbsp; In 
such a rig did the swells of the last generation stroll down Pall
Mall or drive their tilburys in the Bois.</p>
<p>The recent illness of the Prince de Sagan has made a strange 
and sad impression in many circles in Paris, for he has always 
been a favorite, and is the last surviving type of a now extinct 
species.&nbsp; He is the last Dandy!&nbsp; No understudy will be 
found to fill his r&ocirc;le&mdash;the dude and the swell are 
whole generations away from the dandy, of which they are but 
feeble reflections&mdash;the comedy will have to be continued 
now, without its leading gentleman.&nbsp; With his head of 
silvery hair, his eye-glass and his wonderful waistcoats, he held
the first place in the &ldquo;high life&rdquo; of the French 
capital.</p>
<p>No first night or ball was complete without him, Sagan.&nbsp; 
The very mention of his name in their articles must have kept the
wolf from the door of needy reporters.&nbsp; No 
<i>d&eacute;butante</i>, social or theatrical, felt sure of her 
success until it had received the hall-mark of his 
approval.&nbsp; When he assisted at a dress rehearsal, the actors
and the managers paid him more attention than Sarcey or Sardou, 
for he was known to be the real arbiter of their fate.&nbsp; His 
word was law, the world bowed before it as before the will of an 
autocrat.&nbsp; Mature matrons received his dictates with the 
same reverence that the Old Guard evinced for Napoleon&rsquo;s 
orders.&nbsp; Had he not led them on to victory in their 
youth?</p>
<p>On the boulevards or at a race-course, he was the one person 
always known by sight and pointed out.&nbsp; &ldquo;There goes 
Sagan!&rdquo;&nbsp; He had become an institution.&nbsp; One does 
not know exactly how or why he achieved the position, which made 
him the most followed, flattered, and copied man of his 
day.&nbsp; It certainly was unique!</p>
<p>The Prince of Sagan is descended from Maurice de Saxe (the 
natural son of the King of Saxony and Aurora of 
K&oelig;nigsmark), who in his day shone brilliantly at the French
court and was so madly loved by Adrienne Lecouvreur.&nbsp; From 
his great ancestor, Sagan inherited the title of Grand Duke Of 
Courland (the estates have been absorbed into a neighboring 
empire).&nbsp; Nevertheless, he is still an R.H., and when 
crowned heads visit Paris they dine with him and receive him on a
footing of equality.&nbsp; He married a great fortune, and the 
daughter of the banker Selliere.&nbsp; Their house on the 
Esplanade des Invalides has been for years the centre of 
aristocratic life in Paris; not the most exclusive circle, but 
certainly the gayest of this gay capital, and from the days of 
Louis Philippe he has given the keynote to the fast set.</p>
<p>Oddly enough, he has always been a great favorite with the 
lower classes (a popularity shared by all the famous dandies of 
history).&nbsp; The people appear to find in them the 
personification of all aspirations toward the elegant and the 
ideal.&nbsp; Alcibiades, Buckingham, the Duc de Richelieu, Lord 
Seymour, Comte d&rsquo;Orsay, Brummel, Grammont-Caderousse, 
shared this favor, and have remained legendary characters, to 
whom their disdain for everything vulgar, their worship of their 
own persons, and many costly follies gave an ephemeral 
empire.&nbsp; Their power was the more arbitrary and despotic in 
that it was only nominal and undefined, allowing them to rule 
over the fashions, the tastes, and the pastimes of their 
contemporaries with undivided sway, making them envied, obeyed, 
loved, but rarely overthrown.</p>
<p>It has been asserted by some writers that dandies are 
necessary and useful to a nation (Thackeray admired them and 
pointed out that they have a most difficult and delicate 
r&ocirc;le to play, hence their rarity), and that these 
butterflies, as one finds them in the novels of that day, the de 
Marsys, the Pelhams, the Maxime de Trailles, are indispensable to
the perfection of society.&nbsp; It is a great misfortune to a 
country to have no dandies, those supreme virtuosos of taste and 
distinction.&nbsp; Germany, which glories in Mozart and Kant, 
Goethe and Humboldt, the country of deep thinkers and brave 
soldiers, never had a great dandy, and so has remained behind 
England or France in all that constitutes the graceful side of 
life, the refinements of social intercourse, and the art of 
living.&nbsp; France will perceive too late, after he has 
disappeared, the loss she has sustained when this Prince, Grand 
Seigneur, has ceased to embellish by his presence her 
race-courses and &ldquo;first nights.&rdquo;&nbsp; A reputation 
like his cannot be improvised in a moment, and he has no 
pupils.</p>
<p>Never did the aristocracy of a country stand in greater need 
of such a representation, than in these days of tramcars and 
&ldquo;fixed-price&rdquo; restaurants.&nbsp; An entire 
&ldquo;art&rdquo; dies with him.&nbsp; It has been whispered that
he has not entirely justified his reputation, that the accounts 
of his exploits as a <i>haut viveur</i> have gained in the 
telling.&nbsp; Nevertheless he dominated an epoch, rising above 
the tumultuous and levelling society of his day, a tardy Don 
Quixote, of the knighthood of pleasures, <i>f&ecirc;tes</i>, 
loves and prodigalities, which are no longer of our time.&nbsp; 
His great name, his grand manner, his elderly graces, his serene 
carelessness, made him a being by himself.&nbsp; No one will 
succeed this master of departed elegances.&nbsp; If he does not 
recover from his attack, if the paralysis does not leave that 
poor brain, worn out with doing nothing, we can honestly say that
he is the last of his kind.</p>
<p>An original and independent thinker has asserted that 
civilizations, societies, empires, and republics go down to 
posterity typified for the admiration of mankind, each under the 
form of some hero.&nbsp; Emerson would have given a place in his 
Pantheon to Sagan.&nbsp; For it is he who sustained the 
traditions and became the type of that distinguished and 
frivolous society, which judged that serious things were of no 
importance, enthusiasm a waste of time, literature a bore; that 
nothing was interesting and worthy of occupying their attention 
except the elegant distractions that helped to pass their 
days-and nights!&nbsp; He had the merit (?) in these days of the 
practical and the commonplace, of preserving in his gracious 
person all the charming uselessness of a courtier in a country 
where there was no longer a court.</p>
<p>What a strange sight it would be if this departing dandy 
could, before he leaves for ever the theatre of so many triumphs,
take his place at some street corner, and review the shades of 
the companions his long life had thrown him with, the endless 
procession of departed belles and beaux, who, in their youth, 
had, under his rule, helped to dictate the fashions and lead the 
sports of a world.</p>
<h2>No. 28&mdash;A Nation on the Wing</h2>
<p>On being taken the other day through a large and costly 
residence, with the thoroughness that only the owner of a new 
house has the cruelty to inflict on his victims, not allowing 
them to pass a closet or an electric bell without having its 
particular use and convenience explained, forcing them to look up
coal-slides, and down air-shafts and to visit every secret place,
from the cellar to the fire-escape, I noticed that a peculiar 
arrangement of the rooms repeated itself on each floor, and 
several times on a floor.&nbsp; I remarked it to my host.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You observe it,&rdquo; he said, with a blush of pride, 
&ldquo;it is my wife&rsquo;s idea!&nbsp; The truth is, my 
daughters are of a marrying age, and my sons starting out for 
themselves; this house will soon be much too big for two old 
people to live in alone.&nbsp; We have planned it so that at any 
time it can be changed into an apartment house at a nominal 
expense.&nbsp; It is even wired and plumbed with that end in 
view!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This answer positively took my breath away.&nbsp; I looked at 
my host in amazement.&nbsp; It was hard to believe that a man 
past middle age, who after years of hardest toil could afford to 
put half a million into a house for himself and his children, and
store it with beautiful things, would have the courage to look so
far into the future as to see all his work undone, his home 
turned to another use and himself and his wife afloat in the 
world without a roof over their wealthy old heads.</p>
<p>Surely this was the Spirit of the Age in its purest 
expression, the more strikingly so that he seemed to feel pride 
rather than anything else in his ingenious combination.</p>
<p>He liked the city he had built in well enough now, but nothing
proved to him that he would like it later.&nbsp; He and his wife 
had lived in twenty cities since they began their brave fight 
with Fortune, far away in a little Eastern town.&nbsp; They had 
since changed their abode with each ascending rung of the ladder 
of success, and beyond a faded daguerreotype or two of their 
children and a few modest pieces of jewelry, stored away in 
cotton, it is doubtful if they owned a single object belonging to
their early life.</p>
<p>Another case occurs to me.&nbsp; Near the village where I pass
my summers, there lived an elderly, childless couple on a 
splendid estate combining everything a fastidious taste could 
demand.&nbsp; One fine morning this place was sold, the important
library divided between the village and their native city, the 
furniture sold or given away,&mdash;everything went; at the end 
the things no one wanted were made into a bon-fire and 
burned.</p>
<p>A neighbor asking why all this was being done was told by the 
lady, &ldquo;We were tired of it all and have decided to be 
&lsquo;Bohemians&rsquo; for the rest of our lives.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
This couple are now wandering about Europe and half a dozen 
trunks contain their belongings.</p>
<p>These are, of course, extreme cases and must be taken for what
they are worth; nevertheless they are straws showing which way 
the wind blows, signs of the times that he who runs may 
read.&nbsp; I do not run, but I often saunter up our principal 
avenue, and always find myself wondering what will be the future 
of the splendid residences that grace that thoroughfare as it 
nears the Park; the ascending tide of trade is already circling 
round them and each year sees one or more crumble away and 
disappear.</p>
<p>The finer buildings may remain, turned into clubs or 
restaurants, but the greater part of the newer ones are so 
ill-adapted to any other use than that for which they are built 
that their future seems obscure.</p>
<p>That fashion will flit away from its present haunts there can 
be little doubt; the city below the Park is sure to be given up 
to business, and even the fine frontage on that green space will 
sooner or later be occupied by hotels, if not stores; and he who 
builds with any belief in the permanency of his surroundings must
indeed be of a hopeful disposition.</p>
<p>A good lady occupying a delightful corner on this same avenue,
opposite a one-story florist&rsquo;s shop, said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall remain here until they build across the way; 
then I suppose I shall have to move.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So after all the man who is contented to live in a future 
apartment house, may not be so very far wrong.</p>
<p>A case of the opposite kind is that of a great millionaire, 
who, dying, left his house and its collections to his eldest son 
and his grandson after him, on the condition that they should 
continue to live in it.</p>
<p>Here was an attempt to keep together a home with its memories 
and associations.&nbsp; What has been the result?&nbsp; The 
street that was a charming centre for residences twenty years ago
has become a &ldquo;slum;&rdquo; the unfortunate heirs find 
themselves with a house on their hands that they cannot live in 
and are forbidden to rent or sell.&nbsp; As a final result the 
will must in all probability be broken and the matter ended.</p>
<p>Of course the reason for a great deal of this is the 
phenomenal growth of our larger cities.&nbsp; Hundreds of 
families who would gladly remain in their old homes are fairly 
pushed out of them by the growth of business.</p>
<p>Everything has its limits and a time must come when our cities
will cease to expand or when centres will be formed as in London 
or Paris, where generations may succeed each other in the same 
homes.&nbsp; So far, I see no indications of any such 
crystallization in this our big city; we seem to be condemned 
like the &ldquo;Wandering Jew&rdquo; or poor little 
&ldquo;Joe&rdquo; to be perpetually &ldquo;moving on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At a dinner of young people not long ago a Frenchman visiting 
our country, expressed his surprise on hearing a girl speak of 
&ldquo;not remembering the house she was born in.&rdquo;&nbsp; 
Piqued by his manner the young lady answered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are twenty-four at this table.&nbsp; I do not 
believe there is one person here living in the house in which he 
or she was born.&rdquo;&nbsp; This assertion raised a murmur of 
dissent around the table; on a census being taken it proved, 
however, to be true.</p>
<p>How can one expect, under circumstances like these, to find 
any great respect among young people for home life or the 
conservative side of existence?&nbsp; They are born as it were on
the wing, and on the wing will they live.</p>
<p>The conditions of life in this country, although contributing 
largely to such a state of affairs, must not be held, however, 
entirely responsible.&nbsp; Underlying our civilization and 
culture, there is still strong in us a wild nomadic strain 
inherited from a thousand generations of wandering ancestors, 
which breaks out so soon as man is freed from the restraint 
incumbent on bread-winning for his family.&nbsp; The moment there
is wealth or even a modest income insured, comes the inclination 
to cut loose from the dull routine of business and duty, 
returning instinctively to the migratory habits of primitive 
man.</p>
<p>We are not the only nation that has given itself up to 
globe-trotting; it is strong in the English, in spite of their 
conservative education, and it is surprising to see the number of
formerly stay-at-home French and Germans one meets wandering in 
foreign lands.</p>
<p>In 1855, a Londoner advertised the plan he had conceived of 
taking some people over to visit the International Exhibition in 
Paris.&nbsp; For a fixed sum paid in advance he offered to 
provide everything and act as courier to the party, and succeeded
with the greatest difficulty in getting together ten 
people.&nbsp; From this modest beginning has grown the vast 
undertaking that to-day covers the globe with tourists, from the 
frozen seas where they &ldquo;do&rdquo; the midnight sun, to the 
deserts three thousand miles up the Nile.</p>
<p>As I was returning a couple of years ago <i>via</i> Vienna 
from Constantinople, the train was filled with a party of our 
compatriots conducted by an agency of this kind&mdash;simple 
people of small means who, twenty years ago, would as soon have 
thought of leaving their homes for a trip in the East as they 
would of starting off in balloons en route for the inter-stellar 
spaces.</p>
<p>I doubted at the time as to the amount of information and 
appreciation they brought to bear on their travels, so I took 
occasion to draw one of the thin, unsmiling women into 
conversation, asking her where they intended stopping next.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At Buda-Pesth,&rdquo; she answered.&nbsp; I said in 
some amusement:</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that was Buda-Pesth we visited so carefully 
yesterday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, was it,&rdquo; she replied, without any visible 
change on her face, &ldquo;I thought we had not got there 
yet.&rdquo;&nbsp; Apparently it was enough for her to be 
travelling; the rest was of little importance.&nbsp; Later in the
day, when asked if she had visited a certain old city in Germany,
she told me she had but would never go there again: &ldquo;They 
gave us such poor coffee at the hotel.&rdquo;&nbsp; Again later 
in speaking to her husband, who seemed a trifle vague as to 
whether he had seen Nuremberg or not, she said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, you remember it very well; it was there you bought
those nice overshoes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>All of which left me with some doubts in my mind as to the 
cultivating influences of foreign travel on their minds.</p>
<p>You cannot change a leopard&rsquo;s spots, neither can you 
alter the nature of a race, and one of the strongest 
characteristics of the Anglo-Saxon, is the nomadic 
instinct.&nbsp; How often one hears people say:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not going to sit at home and take care of my 
furniture.&nbsp; I want to see something of the world before I am
too old.&rdquo;&nbsp; Lately, a sprightly maiden of uncertain 
years, just returned from a long trip abroad, was asked if she 
intended now to settle down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Settle down, indeed!&nbsp; I&rsquo;m a butterfly and I 
never expect to settle down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There is certainly food here for reflection.&nbsp; Why should 
we be more inclined to wander than our neighbors?&nbsp; Perhaps 
it is in a measure due to our nervous, restless temperament, 
which is itself the result of our climate; but whatever the cause
is, inability to remain long in one place is having a most 
unfortunate influence on our social life.&nbsp; When everyone is 
on the move or longing to be, it becomes difficult to form any 
but the most superficial ties; strong friendships become 
impossible, the most intimate family relations are loosened.</p>
<p>If one were of a speculative frame of mind and chose to take 
as the basis for a calculation the increase in tourists between 
1855, when the ten pioneers started for Paris, and the number 
&ldquo;personally conducted&rdquo; over land and sea to-day, and 
then glance forward at what the future will be if this ratio of 
increase is maintained the result would be something too awful 
for words.&nbsp; For if ten have become a million in forty years,
what will be the total in 1955?&nbsp; Nothing less than entire 
nations given over to sight-seeing, passing their lives and 
incomes in rushing aimlessly about.</p>
<p>If the facilities of communication increase as they 
undoubtedly will with the demand, the prospect becomes nearer the
idea of a &ldquo;Walpurgis Night&rdquo; than anything else.&nbsp;
For the earth and the sea will be covered and the air filled with
every form of whirling, flying, plunging device to get men 
quickly from one place to another.</p>
<p>Every human being on the globe will be flying South for the 
cold months and North for the hot season.</p>
<p>As personally conducted tours have been so satisfactory, 
agencies will be started to lead us through all the stages of 
existence.&nbsp; Parents will subscribe on the birth of their 
children to have them personally conducted through life and 
everything explained as it is done at present in the galleries 
abroad; food, lodging and reading matter, husbands and wives will
be provided by contract, to be taken back and changed if 
unsatisfactory, as the big stores do with their goods.&nbsp; 
Delightful prospect!&nbsp; Homes will become superfluous, parents
and children will only meet when their &ldquo;tours&rdquo; happen
to cross each other.&nbsp; Our great-grandchildren will float 
through life freed from every responsibility and more perfectly 
independent than even that delightful dreamer, Bellamy, ventured 
to predict.</p>
<h2>No. 29&mdash;Husks</h2>
<p>Among the Protestants driven from France by that astute and 
liberal-minded sovereign Louis XIV., were a colony of weavers, 
who as all the world knows, settled at Spitalfields in England, 
where their descendants weave silk to this day.</p>
<p>On their arrival in Great Britain, before the looms could be 
set up and a market found for their industry, the exiles were 
reduced to the last extremity of destitution and hunger.&nbsp; 
Looking about them for anything that could be utilized for food, 
they discovered that the owners of English slaughter-houses threw
away as worthless, the tails of the cattle they killed.&nbsp; 
Like all the poor in France, these wanderers were excellent 
cooks, and knew that at home such caudal appendages were highly 
valued for the tenderness and flavor of the meat.&nbsp; To the 
amazement and disgust of the English villagers the new arrivals 
proceeded to collect this &ldquo;refuse&rdquo; and carry it home 
for food.&nbsp; As the first principle of French culinary art is 
the <i>pot-au-feu</i>, the tails were mostly converted into soup,
on which the exiles thrived and feasted.</p>
<p>Their neighbors, envious at seeing the despised French 
indulging daily in savory dishes, unknown to English palates, and
tempted like &ldquo;Jack&rsquo;s&rdquo; giant by the smell of 
&ldquo;fresh meat,&rdquo; began to inquire into the matter, and 
slowly realized how, in their ignorance, they had been throwing 
away succulent and delicate food.&nbsp; The news of this 
discovery gradually spreading through all classes, 
&ldquo;ox-tail&rdquo; became and has remained the national 
English soup.</p>
<p>If this veracious tale could be twisted into a metaphor, it 
would serve marvellously to illustrate the position of the entire
Anglo-Saxon race, and especially that of their American 
descendants as regards the Latin peoples.&nbsp; For foolish 
prodigality and reckless, ignorant extravagance, however, we 
leave our English cousins far behind.</p>
<p>Two American hotels come to my mind, as different in their 
appearance and management as they are geographically 
asunder.&nbsp; Both are types and illustrations of the wilful 
waste that has recently excited Mr. Ian Maclaren&rsquo;s comment,
and the woeful want (of good food) that is the result.&nbsp; At 
one, a dreary shingle construction on a treeless island, off our 
New England coast, where the ideas of the landlord and his guests
have remained as unchanged and primitive as the island itself, I 
found on inquiry that all articles of food coming from the first 
table were thrown into the sea; and I have myself seen chickens 
hardly touched, rounds of beef, trays of vegetables, and every 
variety of cake and dessert tossed to the fish.</p>
<p>While we were having soups so thin and tasteless that they 
would have made a French house-wife blush, the ingredients 
essential to an excellent &ldquo;stock&rdquo; were cast 
aside.&nbsp; The boarders were paying five dollars a day and 
appeared contented, the place was packed, the landlord coining 
money, so it was foolish to expect any improvement.</p>
<p>The other hotel, a vast caravansary in the South, where a 
fortune had been lavished in providing every modern convenience 
and luxury, was the &ldquo;fad&rdquo; of its wealthy owner.&nbsp;
I had many talks with the manager during my stay, and came to 
realize that most of the wastefulness I saw around me was not his
fault, but that of the public, to whose taste he was obliged to 
cater.&nbsp; At dinner, after receiving your order, the waiter 
would disappear for half an hour, and then bring your entire meal
on one tray, the over-cooked meats stranded in lakes of 
coagulated gravy, the entrees cold and the ices warm.&nbsp; He 
had generally forgotten two or three essentials, but to send back
for them meant to wait another half-hour, as his other clients 
were clamoring to be served.&nbsp; So you ate what was before you
in sulky disgust, and got out of the room as quickly as 
possible.</p>
<p>After one of these gastronomic races, being hungry, flustered,
and suffering from indigestion, I asked mine host if it had never
occurred to him to serve a <i>table d&rsquo;h&ocirc;te</i> dinner
(in courses) as is done abroad, where hundreds of people dine at 
the same moment, each dish being offered them in turn accompanied
by its accessories.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, I have thought of it,&rdquo; he 
answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;It would be the greatest improvement that 
could be introduced into American hotel-keeping.&nbsp; No one 
knows better than I do how disastrous the present system is to 
all parties.&nbsp; Take as an example of the present way, the 
dinner I am going to give you to-morrow, in honor of 
Christmas.&nbsp; Glance over this <i>menu</i>.&nbsp; You will see
that it enumerates every costly and delicate article of food 
possible to procure and a long list of other dishes, the greater 
part of which will not even be called for.&nbsp; As no number of 
<i>chefs</i> could possibly oversee the proper preparation of 
such a variety of meats and sauces, all will be carelessly 
cooked, and as you know by experience, poorly served.</p>
<p>&ldquo;People who exact useless variety,&rdquo; he added, 
&ldquo;are sure in some way to be the sufferers; in their anxiety
to try everything, they will get nothing worth eating.&nbsp; Yet 
that meal will cost me considerably more than my guests pay for 
their twenty-four hours&rsquo; board and lodging.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do it, you ask?&nbsp; Because it is the custom, and
because it will be an advertisement.&nbsp; These bills of fare 
will be sown broadcast over the country in letters to friends and
kept as souvenirs.&nbsp; If, instead of all this senseless 
superfluity, I were allowed to give a <i>table 
d&rsquo;h&ocirc;te</i> meal to-morrow, with the <i>chef</i> I 
have, I could provide an exquisite dinner, perfect in every 
detail, served at little tables as deftly and silently as in a 
private house.&nbsp; I could also discharge half of my waiters, 
and charge two dollars a day instead of five dollars, and the 
hotel would become (what it has never been yet) a paying 
investment, so great would he the saving.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only this morning,&rdquo; he continued, warming to his 
subject, &ldquo;while standing in the dining room, I saw a young 
man order and then send away half the dishes on the 
<i>menu</i>.&nbsp; A chicken was broiled for him and rejected; a 
steak and an omelette fared no better.&nbsp; How much do you 
suppose a hotel gains from a guest like that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The reason Americans put up with such poor viands in 
hotels is, that home cooking in this country is so rudimentary, 
consisting principally of fried dishes, and hot breads.&nbsp; So 
little is known about the proper preparation of food that 
to-morrow&rsquo;s dinner will appear to many as the <i>ne plus 
ultra</i> of delicate living.&nbsp; One of the charms of a hotel 
for people who live poorly at home, lies in this power to order 
expensive dishes they rarely or never see on their own 
tables.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be served with a quantity of food that he has but 
little desire to eat is one of an American citizen&rsquo;s 
dearest privileges, and a right he will most unwillingly 
relinquish.&nbsp; He may know as well as you and I do, that what 
he calls for will not be worth eating; that is of secondary 
importance, he has it before him, and is contented.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The hotel that attempted limiting the liberty of its 
guests to the extent of serving them a <i>table 
d&rsquo;h&ocirc;te</i> dinner, would be emptied in a 
week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A crowning incongruity, as most people are delighted to
dine with friends, or at public functions, where the meal is 
invariably served <i>&agrave; la russe</i> (another name for a 
<i>table d&rsquo;h&ocirc;te</i>), and on these occasions are only
too glad to have their <i>menu</i> chosen for them.&nbsp; The 
present way, however, is a remnant of &lsquo;old times&rsquo; and
the average American, with all his love of change and novelty, is
very conservative when it comes to his table.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What this manager did not confide to me, but what I discovered
later for myself, was that to facilitate the service, and avoid 
confusion in the kitchens, it had become the custom at all the 
large and most of the small hotels in this country, to carve the 
joints, cut up the game, and portion out vegetables, an hour or 
two before meal time.&nbsp; The food, thus arranged, is placed in
vast steam closets, where it simmers gayly for hours, in its own,
and fifty other vapors.</p>
<p>Any one who knows the rudiments of cookery, will recognize 
that with this system no viand can have any particular flavor, 
the partridges having a taste of their neighbor the roast beef, 
which in turn suggests the plum pudding it has been 
&ldquo;chumming&rdquo; with.</p>
<p>It is not alone in a hotel that we miss the good in grasping 
after the better.&nbsp; Small housekeeping is apparently run on 
the same lines.</p>
<p>A young Frenchman, who was working in my rooms, told me in 
reply to a question regarding prices, that every kind of food was
cheaper here than abroad, but the prejudice against certain 
dishes was so strong in this country that many of the best things
in the markets were never called for.&nbsp; Our nation is no 
longer in its &ldquo;teens&rdquo; and should cease to act like a 
foolish boy who has inherited (what appears to him) a limitless 
fortune; not for fear of his coming, like his prototype in the 
parable, to live on &ldquo;husks&rdquo; for he is doing that 
already, but lest like the dog of the fable, in grasping after 
the shadow of a banquet he miss the simple meal that is within 
his reach.</p>
<p>One of the reasons for this deplorable state of affairs lies 
in the foolish education our girls receive.&nbsp; They learn so 
little housekeeping at home, that when married they are obliged 
to begin all over again, unless they prefer, like a majority of 
their friends, to let things as go at the will and discretion of 
the &ldquo;lady&rdquo; below stairs.</p>
<p>At both hotels I have referred to, the families of the men 
interested considered it beneath them to know what was taking 
place.&nbsp; The &ldquo;daughter&rdquo; of the New England house 
went semi-weekly to Boston to take violin lessons at ten dollars 
each, although she had no intention of becoming a professional, 
while the wife wrote poetry and ignored the hotel side of her 
life entirely.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;better half&rdquo; of the Florida establishment 
hired a palace in Rome and entertained ambassadors.&nbsp; Hotels 
divided against themselves are apt to be establishments where you
pay for riotous living and are served only with husks.</p>
<p>We have many hard lessons ahead of us, and one of the hardest 
will be for our nation to learn humbly from the thrifty emigrants
on our shores, the great art of utilizing the &ldquo;tails&rdquo;
that are at this moment being so recklessly thrown away.</p>
<p>As it is, in spite of markets overflowing with every fish, 
vegetable, and tempting viand, we continue to be the worst fed, 
most meagrely nourished of all the wealthy nations on the face of
the earth.&nbsp; We have a saying (for an excellent reason 
unknown on the Continent) that Providence provides us with food 
and the devil sends the cooks!&nbsp; It would be truer to say 
that the poorer the food resources of a nation, the more 
restricted the choice of material, the better the cooks; a small 
latitude when providing for the table forcing them to a hundred 
clever combinations and mysterious devices to vary the monotony 
of their cuisine and tempt a palate, by custom staled.</p>
<p>Our heedless people, with great variety at their disposition, 
are unequal to the situation, wasting and discarding the best, 
and making absolutely nothing of their advantages.</p>
<p>If we were enjoying our prodigality by living on the fat of 
the land, there would be less reason to reproach ourselves, for 
every one has a right to live as he pleases.&nbsp; But as it is, 
our foolish prodigals are spending their substance, while eating 
the husks!</p>
<h2>No. 30&mdash;The Faubourg of St. Germain</h2>
<p>There has been too much said and written in the last dozen 
years about breaking down the &ldquo;great wall&rdquo; behind 
which the aristocrats of the famous Faubourg, like the 
Celestials, their prototypes, have ensconced themselves.&nbsp; 
The Chinese speak of outsiders as &ldquo;barbarians.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The French ladies refer to such unfortunates as being 
&ldquo;beyond the pale.&rdquo;&nbsp; Almost all that has been 
written is arrant nonsense; that imaginary barrier exists to-day 
on as firm a foundation, and is guarded by sentinels as vigilant 
as when, forty years ago, Napoleon (third of the name) and his 
Spanish spouse mounted to its assault.</p>
<p>Their repulse was a bitter humiliation to the <i>parvenue</i> 
Empress, whose resentment took the form (along with many other 
curious results) of opening the present Boulevard St. Germain, 
its line being intentionally carried through the heart of that 
quarter, teeming with historic &ldquo;Hotels&rdquo; of the old 
aristocracy, where beautiful constructions were mercilessly torn 
down to make way for the new avenue.&nbsp; The cajoleries which 
Eug&eacute;nie first tried and the blows that followed were alike
unavailing.&nbsp; Even her worship of Marie Antoinette, between 
whom and herself she found imaginary resemblances, failed to warm
the stony hearts of the proud old ladies, to whom it was as gall 
and wormwood to see a nobody crowned in the palace of their 
kings.&nbsp; Like religious communities, persecution only drew 
this old society more firmly together and made them stand by each
other in their distress.&nbsp; When the Bois was remodelled by 
Napoleon and the lake with its winding drive laid out, the new 
Court drove of an afternoon along this water front.&nbsp; That 
was enough for the old swells!&nbsp; They retired to the remote 
&ldquo;All&eacute;e of the Acacias,&rdquo; and solemnly took 
their airing away from the bustle of the new world, incidentally 
setting a fashion that has held good to this day; the lakeside 
being now deserted, and the &ldquo;Acacias&rdquo; crowded of an 
afternoon, by all that Paris holds of elegant and inelegant.</p>
<p>Where the brilliant Second Empire failed, the Republic had 
little chance of success.&nbsp; With each succeeding year the 
&ldquo;Old Faubourg&rdquo; withdrew more and more into its shell,
going so far, after the fall of Mac Mahon, as to change its 
&ldquo;season&rdquo; to the spring, so that the balls and 
<i>f&ecirc;tes</i> it gave should not coincide with the 
&ldquo;official&rdquo; entertainments during the winter.</p>
<p>The next people to have a &ldquo;shy&rdquo; at the &ldquo;Old 
Faubourg&rsquo;s&rdquo; Gothic battlements were the Jews, who 
were victorious in a few light skirmishes and succeeded in 
capturing one or two illustrious husbands for their 
daughters.&nbsp; The wily Israelites, however, discovered that 
titled sons-in-law were expensive articles and often turned out 
unsatisfactorily, so they quickly desisted.&nbsp; The English, 
the most practical of societies, have always left the Faubourg 
alone.&nbsp; It has been reserved for our countrywomen to lay the
most determined siege yet recorded to that untaken 
stronghold.</p>
<p>It is a characteristic of the American temperament to be 
unable to see a closed door without developing an intense 
curiosity to know what is behind; or to read &ldquo;No Admittance
to the Public&rdquo; over an entrance without immediately 
determining to get inside at any price.&nbsp; So it is easy to 
understand the attraction an hermetically sealed society would 
have for our fair compatriots.&nbsp; Year after year they have 
flung themselves against its closed gateways.&nbsp; Repulsed, 
they have retired only to form again for the attack, but are as 
far away to-day from planting their flag in that citadel as when 
they first began.&nbsp; It does not matter to them what is 
inside; there may be (as in this case) only mouldy old halls and 
a group of people with antiquated ideas and ways.&nbsp; It is 
enough for a certain type of woman to know that she is not wanted
in an exclusive circle, to be ready to die in the attempt to get 
there.&nbsp; This point of view reminds one of Mrs. Snob&rsquo;s 
saying about a new arrival at a hotel: &ldquo;I am sure she must 
be &lsquo;somebody&rsquo; for she was so rude to me when I spoke 
to her;&rdquo; and her answer to her daughter when the girl said 
(on arriving at a watering-place) that she had noticed a very 
nice family &ldquo;who look as if they wanted to know us, 
Mamma:&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, my dear,&rdquo; replied Mamma Snob, &ldquo;they 
certainly are not people we want to meet!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The men in French society are willing enough to make 
acquaintance with foreigners.&nbsp; You may see the youth of the 
Faubourg dancing at American balls in Paris, or running over for 
occasional visits to this country.&nbsp; But when it comes to 
taking their women-kind with them, it is a different 
matter.&nbsp; Americans who have known well-born Frenchmen at 
school or college are surprised, on meeting them later, to be 
asked (cordially enough) to dine <i>en gar&ccedil;on</i> at a 
restaurant, although their Parisian friend is married.&nbsp; An 
Englishman&rsquo;s or American&rsquo;s first word would be on a 
like occasion:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come and dine with me to-night.&nbsp; I want to 
introduce you to my wife.&rdquo;&nbsp; Such an idea would never 
cross a Frenchman&rsquo;s mind!</p>
<p>One American I know is a striking example of this.&nbsp; He 
was born in Paris, went to school and college there, and has 
lived in that city all his life.&nbsp; His sister married a 
French nobleman.&nbsp; Yet at this moment, in spite of his 
wealth, his charming American wife, and many beautiful 
entertainments, he has not one warm French friend, or the 
<i>entr&eacute;e</i> on a footing of intimacy to a single Gallic 
house.</p>
<p>There is no analogy between the English aristocracy and the 
French nobility, except that they are both antiquated 
institutions; the English is the more harmful on account of its 
legislative power, the French is the more pretentious.&nbsp; The 
House of Lords is the most open club in London, the payment of an
entrance-fee in the shape of a check to a party fund being an 
all-sufficient sesame.&nbsp; In France, one must be born in the 
magic circle.&nbsp; The spirit of the Emigration of 1793 is not 
yet extinct.&nbsp; The nobles live in their own world (how 
expressive the word is, seeming to exclude all the rest of 
mankind), pining after an impossible <i>restauration</i>, alien 
to the present day, holding aloof from politics for fear of 
coming in touch with the masses, with whom they pride themselves 
on having nothing in common.</p>
<p>What leads many people astray on this subject is that there 
has formed around this ancient society a circle composed of rich 
&ldquo;outsiders,&rdquo; who have married into good families; and
of eccentric members of the latter, who from a love of excitement
or for interested motives have broken away from their 
traditions.&nbsp; Newly arrived Americans are apt to mistake this
&ldquo;world&rdquo; for the real thing.&nbsp; Into this circle it
is not difficult for foreigners who are rich and anxious to see 
something of life to gain admission.&nbsp; To be received by the 
ladies of this outer circle, seems to our compatriots to be an 
achievement, until they learn the real standing of their new 
acquaintances.</p>
<p>No gayer houses, however, exist than those of the new 
set.&nbsp; At their city or country houses, they entertain 
continually, and they are the people one meets toward five 
o&rsquo;clock, on the grounds of the Polo Club, in the Bois, at 
<i>f&ecirc;tes</i> given by the Island Club of Puteaux, attending
the race meetings, or dining at American houses.&nbsp; As far as 
amusement and fun go, one might seek much further and fare 
worse.</p>
<p>It is very, very rare that foreigners get beyond this 
circle.&nbsp; Occasionally there is a marriage between an 
American girl and some Frenchman of high rank.&nbsp; In these 
cases the girl is, as it were, swallowed up.&nbsp; Her family see
little of her, she rarely appears in general society, and, little
by little, she is lost to her old friends and relations.&nbsp; I 
know of several cases of this kind where it is to be doubted if a
dozen Americans outside of the girls&rsquo; connections know that
such women exist.&nbsp; The fall in rents and land values has 
made the French aristocracy poor; it is only by the greatest 
economy (and it never entered into an American mind to conceive 
of such economy as is practised among them) that they succeed in 
holding on to their historical ch&acirc;teaux or beautiful city 
residences; so that pride plays a large part in the isolation in 
which they live.</p>
<p>The fact that no titles are recognized officially by the 
French government (the most they can obtain being a 
&ldquo;courtesy&rdquo; recognition) has placed these people in a 
singularly false position.&nbsp; An American girl who has married
a Duke is a good deal astonished to find that she is legally only
plain &ldquo;Madame So and So;&rdquo; that when her husband does 
his military service there is no trace of the high-sounding title
to be found in his official papers.&nbsp; Some years ago, a 
colonel was rebuked because he allowed the Duc 
d&rsquo;Alen&ccedil;on to be addressed as 
&ldquo;Monseigneur&rdquo; by the other officers of his 
regiment.&nbsp; This ought to make ambitious papas reflect, when 
they treat themselves to titled sons-in-law.&nbsp; They should at
least try and get an article recognized by the law.</p>
<p>Most of what is written here is perfectly well known to 
resident Americans in Paris, and has been the cause of gradually 
splitting that once harmonious settlement into two perfectly 
distinct camps, between which no love is lost.&nbsp; The members 
of one, clinging to their countrymen&rsquo;s creed of having the 
best or nothing, have been contented to live in France and know 
but few French people, entertaining among themselves and marrying
their daughters to Americans.&nbsp; The members of the other, who
have &ldquo;gone in&rdquo; for French society, take what they can
get, and, on the whole, lead very jolly lives.&nbsp; It often 
happens (perhaps it is only a coincidence) that ladies who have 
not been very successful at home are partial to this circle, 
where they easily find guests for their entertainments and the 
recognition their souls long for.</p>
<p>What the future of the &ldquo;Great Faubourg&rdquo; will be, 
it is hard to say.&nbsp; All hope of a possible 
<i>restauration</i> appears to be lost.&nbsp; Will the proud 
necks that refused to bend to the Orleans dynasty or the two 
&ldquo;empires&rdquo; bow themselves to the republican 
yoke?&nbsp; It would seem as if it must terminate in this way, 
for everything in this world must finish.&nbsp; But the end is 
not yet; one cannot help feeling sympathy for people who are 
trying to live up to their traditions and be true to such 
immaterial idols as &ldquo;honor&rdquo; and &ldquo;family&rdquo; 
in this discouragingly material age, when everything goes down 
before the Golden Calf.&nbsp; Nor does one wonder that men who 
can trace their ancestors back to the Crusades should hesitate to
ally themselves with the last rich <i>parvenu</i> who has raised 
himself from the gutter, or resent the ardor with which the 
latest importation of American ambition tries to chum with them 
and push its way into their life.</p>
<h2>No. 31&mdash;Men&rsquo;s Manners</h2>
<p>Nothing makes one feel so old as to wake up suddenly, as it 
were, and realize that the conditions of life have changed, and 
that the standards you knew and accepted in your youth have been 
raised or lowered.&nbsp; The young men you meet have somehow 
become uncomfortably polite, offering you armchairs in the club, 
and listening with a shade of deference to your stories.&nbsp; 
They are of another generation; their ways are not your ways, nor
their ambitions those you had in younger days.&nbsp; One is 
tempted to look a little closer, to analyze what the change is, 
in what this subtle difference consists, which you feel between 
your past and their present.&nbsp; You are surprised and a little
angry to discover that, among other things, young men have better
manners than were general among the youths of fifteen years 
ago.</p>
<p>Anyone over forty can remember three epochs in men&rsquo;s 
manners.&nbsp; When I was a very young man, there were still 
going about in society a number of gentlemen belonging to what 
was reverently called the &ldquo;old school,&rdquo; who had 
evidently taken Sir Charles Grandison as their model, read Lord 
Chesterfield&rsquo;s letters to his son with attention, and been 
brought up to commence letters to their fathers, &ldquo;Honored 
Parent,&rdquo; signing themselves &ldquo;Your humble servant and 
respectful son.&rdquo;&nbsp; There are a few such old gentlemen 
still to be found in the more conservative clubs, where certain 
windows are tacitly abandoned to these elegant-mannered 
fossils.&nbsp; They are quite harmless unless you happen to find 
them in a reminiscent mood, when they are apt to be a little 
tiresome; it takes their rusty mental machinery so long to get 
working!&nbsp; Washington possesses a particularly fine 
collection among the retired army and navy officers and 
ex-officials.&nbsp; It is a fact well known that no one drawing a
pension ever dies.</p>
<p>About 1875, a new generation with new manners began to make 
its appearance.&nbsp; A number of its members had been educated 
at English universities, and came home burning to upset old ways 
and teach their elders how to live.&nbsp; They broke away from 
the old clubs and started smaller and more exclusive circles 
among themselves, principally in the country.&nbsp; This was a 
period of bad manners.&nbsp; True to their English model, they 
considered it &ldquo;good form&rdquo; to be uncivil and to make 
no effort towards the general entertainment when in 
society.&nbsp; Not to speak more than a word or two during a 
dinner party to either of one&rsquo;s neighbors was the supreme 
<i>chic</i>.&nbsp; As a revolt from the twice-told tales of their
elders they held it to be &ldquo;bad form&rdquo; to tell a story,
no matter how fresh and amusing it might be.&nbsp; An unfortunate
outsider who ventured to tell one in their club was crushed by 
having his tale received in dead silence.&nbsp; When it was 
finished one of the party would &ldquo;ring the bell,&rdquo; and 
the circle order drinks at the expense of the man who had dared 
to amuse them.&nbsp; How the professional story-teller must have 
shuddered&mdash;he whose story never was ripe until it had been 
told a couple of hundred times, and who would produce a certain 
tale at a certain course as surely as clock-work.</p>
<p>That the story-telling type was a bore, I grant.&nbsp; To be 
grabbed on entering your club and obliged to listen to 
Smith&rsquo;s last, or to have the conversation after dinner 
monopolized by Jones and his eternal &ldquo;Speaking of coffee, I
remember once,&rdquo; etc. added an additional hardship to 
existence.&nbsp; But the opposite pose, which became the fashion 
among the reformers, was hardly less wearisome.&nbsp; To sit 
among a group of perfectly mute men, with an occasional word 
dropping into the silence like a stone in a well, was surely 
little better.</p>
<p>A girl told me she had once sat through an entire cotillion 
with a youth whose only remark during the evening had been (after
absorbed contemplation of the articles in question), &ldquo;How 
do you like my socks?&rdquo;</p>
<p>On another occasion my neighbor at table said to me:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think the man on my right has gone to sleep.&nbsp; He
is sitting with his eyes closed!&rdquo;&nbsp; She was 
mistaken.&nbsp; He was practising his newly acquired 
&ldquo;repose of manner,&rdquo; and living up to the standard of 
his set.</p>
<p>The model young man of that period had another offensive 
habit, his pose of never seeing you, which got on the nerves of 
his elders to a considerable extent.&nbsp; If he came into a 
drawing-room where you were sitting with a lady, he would shake 
hands with her and begin a conversation, ignoring your existence,
although you may have been his guest at dinner the night before, 
or he yours.&nbsp; This was also a tenet of his creed borrowed 
from trans-Atlantic cousins, who, by the bye, during the time I 
speak of, found America, and especially our Eastern states, a 
happy hunting-ground,&mdash;all the clubs, country houses, and 
society generally opening their doors to the &ldquo;sesame&rdquo;
of English nationality.&nbsp; It took our innocent youths a good 
ten years to discover that there was no reciprocity in the 
arrangement; it was only in the next epoch (the list of the three
referred to) that our men recovered their self-respect, and 
assumed towards foreigners in general the attitude of polite 
indifference which is their manner to us when abroad.&nbsp; 
Nothing could have been more provincial and narrow than the ideas
of our &ldquo;smart&rdquo; men at that time.&nbsp; They 
congregated in little cliques, huddling together in public, and 
cracking personal old jokes; but were speechless with <i>mauvaise
honte</i> if thrown among foreigners or into other circles of 
society.&nbsp; All this is not to be wondered at considering the 
amount of their general education and reading.&nbsp; One charming
little custom then greatly in vogue among our <i>jeunesse 
dor&eacute;e</i> was to remain at a ball, after the other guests 
had retired, tipsy, and then break anything that came to 
hand.&nbsp; It was so amusing to throw china, glass, or valuable 
plants, out of the windows, to strip to the waist and box or bait
the tired waiters.</p>
<p>I look at the boys growing up around me with sincere 
admiration, they are so superior to their predecessors in 
breeding, in civility, in deference to older people, and in a 
thousand other little ways that mark high-bred men.&nbsp; The 
stray Englishman, of no particular standing at home no longer 
finds our men eager to entertain him, to put their best 
&ldquo;hunter&rdquo; at his disposition, to board, lodge, and 
feed him indefinitely, or make him honorary member of all their 
clubs.&nbsp; It is a constant source of pleasure to me to watch 
this younger generation, so plainly do I see in them the 
influence of their mothers&mdash;women I knew as girls, and who 
were so far ahead of their brothers and husbands in refinement 
and culture.&nbsp; To have seen these girls marry and bring up 
their sons so well has been a satisfaction and a compensation for
many disillusions.&nbsp; Woman&rsquo;s influence will always 
remain the strongest lever that can be brought to bear in raising
the tone of a family; it is impossible not to see about these 
young men a reflection of what we found so charming in their 
mothers.&nbsp; One despairs at times of humanity, seeing 
vulgarity and snobbishness riding triumphantly upward; but where 
the tone of the younger generation is as high as I have lately 
found it, there is still much hope for the future.</p>
<h2>No. 32&mdash;An Ideal Hostess</h2>
<p>The saying that &ldquo;One-half of the world ignores how the 
other half lives&rdquo; received for me an additional 
confirmation this last week, when I had the good fortune to meet 
again an old friend, now for some years retired from the stage, 
where she had by her charm and beauty, as well as by her singing,
held all the Parisian world at her pretty feet.</p>
<p>Our meeting was followed on her part by an invitation to take 
luncheon with her the next day, &ldquo;to meet a few friends, and
talk over old times.&rdquo;&nbsp; So half-past twelve (the 
invariable hour for the &ldquo;second breakfast,&rdquo; in 
France) the following day found me entering a shady drawing-room,
where a few people were sitting in the cool half-light that 
strayed across from a canvas-covered balcony furnished with 
plants and low chairs.&nbsp; Beyond one caught a glimpse of 
perhaps the gayest picture that the bright city of Paris 
offers,&mdash;the sweep of the Boulevard as it turns to the Rue 
Royale, the flower market, gay with a thousand colors in the 
summer sunshine, while above all the color and movement, rose, 
cool and gray, the splendid colonnade of the Madeleine.&nbsp; The
rattle of carriages, the roll of the heavy omnibuses and the 
shrill cries from the street below floated up, softened into a 
harmonious murmur that in no way interfered with our 
conversation, and is sweeter than the finest music to those who 
love their Paris.</p>
<p>Five or six rooms <i>en suite</i> opening on the street, and 
as many more on a large court, formed the apartment, where 
everything betrayed the <i>artiste</i> and the singer.&nbsp; The 
walls, hung with silk or tapestry, held a collection of original 
drawings and paintings, a fortune in themselves; the dozen 
portraits of our hostess in favorite r&ocirc;les were by men 
great in the art world; a couple of pianos covered with well-worn
music and numberless photographs signed with names that would 
have made an autograph-fiend&rsquo;s mouth water.</p>
<p>After a gracious, cooing welcome, more whispered than spoken, 
I was presented to the guests I did not know.&nbsp; Before this 
ceremony was well over, two maids in black, with white caps, 
opened a door into the dining-room and announced luncheon.&nbsp; 
As this is written on the theme that &ldquo;people know too 
little how their neighbors live,&rdquo; I give the 
<i>menu</i>.&nbsp; It may amuse my readers and serve, perhaps, as
a little object lesson to those at home who imagine that quantity
and not quality is of importance.</p>
<p>Our gracious hostess had earned a fortune in her profession 
(and I am told that two <i>chefs</i> preside over her simple 
meals); so it was not a spirit of economy which dictated this 
simplicity.&nbsp; At first, <i>hors d&rsquo;&oelig;uvres</i> were
served,&mdash;all sorts of tempting little things,&mdash;very 
thin slices of ham, spiced sausages, olives and caviar, and 
eaten&mdash;not merely passed and refused.&nbsp; Then came the 
one hot dish of the meal.&nbsp; &ldquo;One!&rdquo;&nbsp; I think 
I hear my reader exclaim.&nbsp; Yes, my friend, but that one was 
a marvel in its way.&nbsp; Chicken <i>a l&rsquo;espagnole</i>, 
boiled, and buried in rice and tomatoes cooked whole&mdash;a dish
to be dreamed of and remembered in one&rsquo;s prayers and 
thanksgivings!&nbsp; After at least two helpings each to this 
<i>chef-d&rsquo;&oelig;uvre</i>, cold larded fillet and a meat 
<i>p&acirc;t&eacute;</i> were served with the salad.&nbsp; Then a
bit of cheese, a beaten cream of chocolate, fruit, and 
bon-bons.&nbsp; For a drink we had the white wine from which 
champagne is made (by a chemical process and the addition of many
injurious ingredients); in other words, a pure <i>brut</i> 
champagne with just a suggestion of sparkle at the bottom of your
glass.&nbsp; All the party then migrated together into the 
smoking-room for cigarettes, coffee, and a tiny glass of 
<i>liqueur</i>.</p>
<p>These details have been given at length, not only because the 
meal seemed to me, while I was eating it, to be worthy of whole 
columns of print, but because one of the besetting sins of our 
dear land is to serve a profusion of food no one wants and which 
the hostess would never have dreamed of ordering had she been 
alone.</p>
<p>Nothing is more wearisome than to sit at table and see course 
after course, good, bad, and indifferent, served, after you have 
eaten what you want.&nbsp; And nothing is more vulgar than to 
serve them; for either a guest refuses a great deal of the food 
and appears uncivil, or he must eat, and regret it 
afterwards.&nbsp; If we ask people to a meal, it should be to 
such as we eat, as a general thing, ourselves, and such as they 
would have at home.&nbsp; Otherwise it becomes ostentation and 
vulgarity.&nbsp; Why should one be expelled to eat more than 
usual because a friend has been nice enough to ask one to take 
one&rsquo;s dinner with him, instead of eating it alone?&nbsp; It
is the being among friends that tempts, not the food; the fact at
skilful waiters have been able to serve a dozen varieties of 
fish, flesh, and fowl during the time you were at table has added
little to any one&rsquo;s pleasure.&nbsp; On the contrary!&nbsp; 
Half the time one eats from pure absence of mind, a number of 
most injurious mixtures and so prepares an awful to-morrow and 
the foundation of many complicated diseases.</p>
<p>I see Smith and Jones daily at the club, where we dine 
cheerfully together on soup, a cut of the joint, a dessert, and 
drink a pint of claret.&nbsp; But if either Mrs. Smith or Mrs. 
Jones asks me to dinner, we have eight courses and half as many 
wines, and Smith will say quite gravely to me, &ldquo;Try this 
&rsquo;75 &lsquo;Perrier Jou&euml;t&rsquo;,&rdquo; as if he were 
in the habit of drinking it daily.&nbsp; It makes me smile, for 
he would as soon think of ordering a bottle of that wine at the 
club as he would think of ordering a flask of nectar.</p>
<p>But to return to our &ldquo;mutton.&rdquo;&nbsp; As we had 
none of us eaten too much (and so become digesting machines), we 
were cheerful and sprightly.&nbsp; A little music followed and an
author repeated some of his poetry.&nbsp; I noticed that during 
the hour before we broke up our hostess contrived to have a 
little talk with each of her guests, which she made quite 
personal, appearing for the moment as though the rest of the 
world did not exist for her, than which there is no more subtle 
flattery, and which is the act of a well-bred and appreciative 
woman.&nbsp; Guests cannot be treated <i>en masse</i> any more 
than food; to ask a man to your house is not enough.&nbsp; He 
should be made to feel, if you wish him to go away with a 
pleasant remembrance of the entertainment, that his presence has 
in some way added to it and been a personal pleasure to his 
host.</p>
<p>A good soul that all New York knew a few years ago, whose 
entertainments were as though the street had been turned into a 
<i>salon</i> for the moment, used to go about among her guests 
saying, &ldquo;There have been one hundred and seventy-five 
people here this Thursday, ten more than last week,&rdquo; with 
such a satisfied smile, that you felt that she had little left to
wish for, and found yourself wondering just which number you 
represented in her mind.&nbsp; When you entered she must have 
murmured a numeral to herself as she shook your hand.</p>
<p>There is more than one house in New York where I have grave 
doubts if the host and hostess are quite sure of my name when I 
dine there; after an abstracted welcome, they rarely put 
themselves out to entertain their guests.&nbsp; Black coats and 
evening dresses alternate in pleasing perspective down the long 
line of their table.&nbsp; Their gold plate is out, and the 
<i>chef</i> has been allowed to work his own sweet will, so they 
give themselves no further trouble.</p>
<p>Why does not some one suggest to these amphitrions to send 
fifteen dollars in prettily monogrammed envelopes to each of 
their friends, requesting them to expend it on a dinner.&nbsp; 
The compliment would be quite as personal, and then the guests 
might make up little parties to suit themselves, which would be 
much more satisfactory than going &ldquo;in&rdquo; with some one 
chosen at hazard from their host&rsquo;s visiting list, and less 
fatiguing to that gentleman and his family.</p>
<h2>No. 33&mdash;The Introducer</h2>
<p>We all suffer more or less from the perennial 
&ldquo;freshness&rdquo; of certain acquaintances&mdash;tiresome 
people whom a misguided Providence has endowed with over-flowing 
vitality and an irrepressible love of their fellowmen, and who, 
not content with looking on life as a continual 
&ldquo;spree,&rdquo; insist on making others happy in spite of 
themselves.&nbsp; Their name is legion and their presence 
ubiquitous, but they rarely annoy as much as when disguised under
the mask of the &ldquo;Introducer.&rdquo;&nbsp; In his clutches 
one is helpless.&nbsp; It is impossible to escape from such 
philanthropic tyranny.&nbsp; He, in his freshness, imagines that 
to present human beings to each other is his mission in this 
world and moves through life making these platonic unions, 
oblivious, as are other match-makers, of the misery he 
creates.</p>
<p>If you are out for a quiet stroll, one of these genial 
gentlemen is sure to come bounding up, and without notice or 
warning present you to his &ldquo;friend,&rdquo;&mdash;the 
greater part of the time a man he has met only an hour before, 
but whom he endows out of the warehouse of his generous 
imagination with several talents and all the virtues.&nbsp; In 
order to make the situation just one shade more uncomfortable, 
this kindly bore proceeds to sing a hymn of praise concerning 
both of you to your faces, adding, in order that you may both 
feel quite friendly and pleasant:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know you two will fancy each other, you are so 
alike,&rdquo;&mdash;a phrase neatly calculated to nip any 
conversation in the bud.&nbsp; You detest the unoffending 
stranger on the spot and would like to kill the bore.&nbsp; Not 
to appear an absolute brute you struggle through some commonplace
phrases, discovering the while that your new acquaintance is no 
more anxious to know you, than you are to meet him; that he has 
not the slightest idea who you are, neither does he desire to 
find out.&nbsp; He classes you with the bore, and his one idea, 
like your own, is to escape.&nbsp; So that the only result of the
Introducer&rsquo;s good-natured interference has been to make two
fellow-creatures miserable.</p>
<p>A friend was telling me the other day of the martyrdom he had 
suffered from this class.&nbsp; He spoke with much feeling, as he
is the soul of amiability, but somewhat short-sighted and 
afflicted with a hopelessly bad memory for faces.&nbsp; For the 
last few years, he has been in the habit of spending one or two 
of the winter months in Washington, where his friends put him up 
at one club or another.&nbsp; Each winter on his first appearance
at one of these clubs, some kindly disposed old fogy is sure to 
present him to a circle of the members, and he finds himself 
indiscriminately shaking hands with Judges and Colonels.&nbsp; As
little or no conversation follows these introductions to fix the 
individuality of the members in his mind, he unconsciously cuts 
two-thirds of his newly acquired circle the next afternoon, and 
the following winter, after a ten-months&rsquo; absence, he 
innocently ignores the other third.&nbsp; So hopelessly has he 
offended in this way, that last season, on being presented to a 
club member, the latter peevishly blurted out:</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the fourth time I have been introduced to Mr. 
Blank, but he never remembers me,&rdquo; and glared coldly at 
him, laying it all down to my friend&rsquo;s snobbishness and to 
the airs of a New Yorker when away from home.&nbsp; If instead of
being sacrificed to the introducer&rsquo;s mistaken zeal my poor 
friend had been left quietly to himself, he would in good time 
have met the people congenial to him and avoided giving offence 
to a number of kindly gentlemen.</p>
<p>This introducing mania takes an even more aggressive form in 
the hostess, who imagines that she is lacking in hospitality if 
any two people in her drawing-room are not made known to each 
other.&nbsp; No matter how interested you may be in a chat with a
friend, you will see her bearing down upon you, bringing in tow 
the one human being you have carefully avoided for years.&nbsp; 
Escape seems impossible, but as a forlorn hope you fling yourself
into conversation with your nearest neighbor, trying by your 
absorbed manner to ward off the calamity.&nbsp; In vain!&nbsp; 
With a tap on your elbow your smiling hostess introduces you and,
having spoiled your afternoon, flits off in search of other 
prey.</p>
<p>The question of introductions is one on which it is impossible
to lay down any fixed rules.&nbsp; There must constantly occur 
situations where one&rsquo;s acts must depend upon a kindly 
consideration for other people&rsquo;s feelings, which after all,
is only another name for tact.&nbsp; Nothing so plainly shows the
breeding of a man or woman as skill in solving problems of this 
kind without giving offence.</p>
<p>Foreigners, with their greater knowledge of the world, rarely 
fall into the error of indiscriminate introducing, appreciating 
what a presentation means and what obligations it entails.&nbsp; 
The English fall into exactly the contrary error from ours, and 
carry it to absurd lengths.&nbsp; Starting with the assumption 
that everybody knows everybody, and being aware of the general 
dread of meeting &ldquo;detrimentals,&rdquo; they avoid the 
difficulty by making no introductions.&nbsp; This may work well 
among themselves, but it is trying to a stranger whom they have 
been good enough to ask to their tables, to sit out the meal 
between two people who ignore his presence and converse across 
him; for an Englishman will expire sooner than speak to a person 
to whom he has not been introduced.</p>
<p>The French, with the marvellous tact that has for centuries 
made them the law-givers on all subjects of etiquette and 
breeding, have another way of avoiding useless 
introductions.&nbsp; They assume that two people meeting in a 
drawing-room belong to the same world and so chat pleasantly with
those around them.&nbsp; On leaving the <i>salon</i> the 
acquaintance is supposed to end, and a gentleman who should at 
another time or place bow or speak to the lady who had offered 
him a cup of tea and talked pleasantly to him over it at a 
friend&rsquo;s reception, would commit a gross breach of 
etiquette.</p>
<p>I was once present at a large dinner given in Cologne to the 
American Geographical Society.&nbsp; No sooner was I seated than 
my two neighbors turned towards me mentioning their names and 
waiting for me to do the same.&nbsp; After that the conversation 
flowed on as among friends.&nbsp; This custom struck me as 
exceedingly well-bred and calculated to make a foreigner feel at 
his ease.</p>
<p>Among other curious types, there are people so constituted 
that they are unhappy if a single person can be found in the room
to whom they have not been introduced.&nbsp; It does not matter 
who the stranger may be or what chance there is of finding him 
congenial.&nbsp; They must be presented; nothing else will 
content them.&nbsp; If you are chatting with a friend you feel a 
pull at your sleeve, and in an audible aside, they ask for an 
introduction.&nbsp; The aspirant will then bring up and present 
the members of his family who happen to be near.&nbsp; After that
he seems to be at ease, and having absolutely nothing to say will
soon drift off.&nbsp; Our public men suffer terribly from 
promiscuous introductions; it is a part of a political career; a 
good memory for names and faces and a cordial manner under fire 
have often gone a long way in floating a statesman on to 
success.</p>
<p>Demand, we are told, creates supply.&nbsp; During a short stay
in a Florida hotel last winter, I noticed a curious little man 
who looked like a cross between a waiter and a musician.&nbsp; As
he spoke to me several times and seemed very officious, I asked 
who he was.&nbsp; The answer was so grotesque that I could not 
believe my ears.&nbsp; I was told that he held the position of 
official &ldquo;introducer,&rdquo; or master of ceremonies, and 
that the guests under his guidance became known to each other, 
danced, rode, and married to their own and doubtless to his 
satisfaction.&nbsp; The further west one goes the more pronounced
this mania becomes.&nbsp; Everybody is introduced to everybody on
all imaginable occasions.&nbsp; If a man asks you to take a 
drink, he presents you to the bar-tender.&nbsp; If he takes you 
for a drive, the cab-driver is introduced.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Boots&rdquo; makes you acquainted with the chambermaid, 
and the hotel proprietor unites you in the bonds of friendship 
with the clerk at the desk.&nbsp; Intercourse with one&rsquo;s 
fellows becomes one long debauch of introduction.&nbsp; In this 
country where every liberty is respected, it is a curious fact 
that we should be denied the most important of all rights, that 
of choosing our acquaintances.</p>
<h2>No. 34&mdash;A Question and an Answer</h2>
<blockquote><p>DEAR IDLER:</p>
<p>I have been reading your articles in <i>The Evening 
Post</i>.&nbsp; They are really most amusing!&nbsp; You do know 
such a lot about people and things, that I am tempted to write 
and ask you a question on a subject that is puzzling me.&nbsp; 
What is it that is necessary to succeed&mdash;socially?&nbsp; 
There!&nbsp; It is out!&nbsp; Please do not laugh at me.&nbsp; 
Such funny people get on and such clever, agreeable ones fail, 
that I am all at sea.&nbsp; Now do be nice and answer me, and you
will have a very grateful</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span 
class="smcap">Admirer</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The above note, in a rather juvenile feminine hand, and 
breathing a faint perfume of <i>violette de Parme</i>, was part 
of the morning&rsquo;s mail that I found lying on my desk a few 
days ago, in delightful contrast to the bills and advertisements 
which formed the bulk of my correspondence.&nbsp; It would 
suppose a stoicism greater than I possess, not to have felt a 
thrill of satisfaction in its perusal.&nbsp; There was, then, 
some one who read with pleasure what I wrote, and who had been 
moved to consult me on a question (evidently to her) of 
importance.&nbsp; I instantly decided to do my best for the 
edification of my fair correspondent (for no doubt entered my 
head that she was both young and fair), the more readily because 
that very question had frequently presented itself to my own mind
on observing the very capricious choice of Dame 
&ldquo;Fashion&rdquo; in the distribution of her favors.</p>
<p>That there are people who succeed brilliantly and move from 
success to success, amid an applauding crowd of friends and 
admirers, while others, apparently their superiors in every way, 
are distanced in the race, is an undeniable fact.&nbsp; You have 
but to glance around the circle of your acquaintances and 
relations to be convinced of this anomaly.&nbsp; To a reflecting 
mind the question immediately presents itself, Why is this?&nbsp;
General society is certainly cultivated enough to appreciate 
intelligence and superior endowments.&nbsp; How then does it 
happen that the social favorites are so often lacking in the 
qualities which at a first glance would seem indispensable to 
success?</p>
<p>Before going any further let us stop a moment, and look at the
subject from another side, for it is more serious than appears to
be on the surface.&nbsp; To be loved by those around us, to stand
well in the world, is certainly the most legitimate as well as 
the most common of ambitions, as well as the incentive to most of
the industry and perseverance in life.&nbsp; Aside from science, 
which is sometimes followed for itself alone, and virtue, which 
we are told looks for no other reward, the hope which inspires a 
great deal of the persistent efforts we see, is generally that of
raising one&rsquo;s self and those one loves by one&rsquo;s 
efforts into a sphere higher than where cruel fate had placed 
them; that they, too, may take their place in the sunshine and 
enjoy the good things of life.&nbsp; This ambition is often 
purely disinterested; a life of hardest toil is cheerfully borne,
with the hope (for sole consolation) that dear ones will profit 
later by all the work, and live in a circle the patient toiler 
never dreams of entering.&nbsp; Surely he is a stern moralist who
would deny this satisfaction to the breadwinner of a family.</p>
<p>There are doubtless many higher motives in life, more elevated
goals toward which struggling humanity should strive.&nbsp; If 
you examine the average mind, however, you will be pretty sure to
find that success is the touchstone by which we judge our fellows
and what, in our hearts, we admire the most.&nbsp; That is not to
be wondered at, either, for we have done all we can to implant it
there.&nbsp; From a child&rsquo;s first opening thought, it is 
impressed upon him that the great object of existence is to 
succeed.&nbsp; Did a parent ever tell a child to try and stand 
last in his class?&nbsp; And yet humility is a virtue we admire 
in the abstract.&nbsp; Are any of us willing to step aside and 
see our inferiors pass us in the race?&nbsp; That is too much to 
ask of poor humanity.&nbsp; Were other and higher standards to be
accepted, the structure of civilization as it exists to-day would
crumble away and the great machine run down.</p>
<p>In returning to my correspondent and her perfectly legitimate 
desire to know the road to success, we must realize that to a 
large part of the world social success is the only kind they 
understand.&nbsp; The great inventors and benefactors of mankind 
live too far away on a plane by themselves to be the object of 
jealousy to any but a very small circle; on the other hand, in 
these days of equality, especially in this country where caste 
has never existed, the social world seems to hold out alluring 
and tangible gifts to him who can enter its enchanted 
portals.&nbsp; Even politics, to judge by the actions of some of 
our legislators, of late, would seem to be only a stepping-stone 
to its door!</p>
<p>&ldquo;But my question,&rdquo; I hear my fair interlocutor 
saying.&nbsp; &ldquo;You are not answering it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>All in good time, my dear.&nbsp; I am just about to do 
so.&nbsp; Did you ever hear of Darwin and his theory of 
&ldquo;selection?&rdquo;&nbsp; It would be a slight to your 
intelligence not to take it for granted that you had.&nbsp; Well,
my observations in the world lead me to believe that we follow 
there unconsciously, the same rules that guide the wild beasts in
the forest.&nbsp; Certain individuals are endowed by nature with 
temperaments which make them take naturally to a social life and 
shine there.&nbsp; In it they find their natural element.&nbsp; 
They develop freely just where others shrivel up and 
disappear.&nbsp; There is continually going on unseen a 
&ldquo;natural selection,&rdquo; the discarding of unfit 
material, the assimilation of new and congenial elements from 
outside, with the logical result of a survival of the 
fittest.&nbsp; Aside from this, you will find in &ldquo;the 
world,&rdquo; as anywhere else, that the person who succeeds is 
generally he who has been willing to give the most of his 
strength and mind to that one object, and has not allowed the 
flowers on the hillside to distract him from his path, 
remembering also that genius is often but the &ldquo;capacity for
taking infinite pains.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There are people so constituted that they cheerfully give the 
efforts of a lifetime to the attainment of a brilliant social 
position.&nbsp; No fatigue is too great, and no snubs too bitter 
to be willingly undergone in pursuit of the cherished 
object.&nbsp; You will never find such an individual, for 
instance, wandering in the flowery byways that lead to art or 
letters, for that would waste his time.&nbsp; If his family are 
too hard to raise, he will abandon the attempt and rise without 
them, for he cannot help himself.&nbsp; He is but an atom working
as blindly upward as the plant that pushes its mysterious way 
towards the sun.&nbsp; Brains are not necessary.&nbsp; Good looks
are but a trump the more in the &ldquo;hand.&rdquo;&nbsp; Manners
may help, but are not essential.&nbsp; The object can be and is 
attained daily without all three.&nbsp; Wealth is but the oil 
that makes the machinery run more smoothly.&nbsp; The 
all-important factor is the desire to succeed, so strong that it 
makes any price seem cheap, and that can pay itself by a step 
gained, for mortification and weariness and heart-burnings.</p>
<p>There, my dear, is the secret of success!&nbsp; I stop because
I feel myself becoming bitter, and that is a frame of mind to be 
carefully avoided, because it interferes with the digestion and 
upsets one&rsquo;s gentle calm!&nbsp; I have tried to answer your
question.&nbsp; The answer resolves itself into these two things;
that it is necessary to be born with qualities which you may not 
possess, and calls for sacrifices you would doubtless be 
unwilling to make.&nbsp; It remains with you to decide if the 
little game is worth the candle.&nbsp; The delightful common 
sense I feel quite sure you possess reassures me as to your 
answer.</p>
<p>Take gayly such good things as may float your way, and profit 
by them while they last.&nbsp; Wander off into all the 
cross-roads that tempt you.&nbsp; Stop often to lend a helping 
hand to a less fortunate traveller.&nbsp; Rest in the heat of the
day, as your spirit prompts you.&nbsp; Sit down before the sunset
and revel in its beauty and you will find your voyage through 
life much more satisfactory to look back to and full of far 
sweeter memories than if by sacrificing any of these pleasures 
you had attained the greatest of &ldquo;positions.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>No. 35&mdash;Living on your Friends</h2>
<p>Thackeray devoted a chapter in &ldquo;Vanity Fair&rdquo; to 
the problem &ldquo;How to Live Well on Nothing a 
Year.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was neither a very new nor a very ingenious
expedient that &ldquo;Becky&rdquo; resorted to when she 
discounted her husband&rsquo;s position and connection to fleece 
the tradespeople and cheat an old family servant out of a 
year&rsquo;s rent.&nbsp; The author might more justly have used 
his clever phrase in describing &ldquo;Major 
Pendennis&rsquo;s&rdquo; agreeable existence.&nbsp; We have made 
great progress in this, as in almost every other mode of living, 
in the latter half of the Victorian era; intelligent individuals 
of either sex, who know the ropes, can now as easily lead the 
existence of a multi-millionaire (with as much satisfaction to 
themselves and their friends) as though the bank account, with 
all its attendant worries, stood in their own names.&nbsp; This 
subject is so vast, its ramifications so far-reaching and 
complicated, that one hesitates before launching into an analysis
of it.&nbsp; It will be better simply to give a few interesting 
examples, and a general rule or two, for the enlightenment and 
guidance of ingenious souls.</p>
<p>Human nature changes little; all that our educational and 
social training has accomplished is a smoothing of the 
surface.&nbsp; One of the most striking proofs of this is, that 
here in our primitive country, as soon as accumulation of capital
allowed certain families to live in great luxury, they returned 
to the ways of older aristocracies, and, with other wants, felt 
the necessity of a court about them, ladies and gentlemen in 
waiting, pages and jesters.&nbsp; Nature abhors a vacuum, so a 
class of people immediately felt an irresistible impulse to rush 
in and fill the void.&nbsp; Our aristocrats were not even obliged
to send abroad to fill these vacancies, as they were for their 
footmen and butlers; the native article was quite ready and 
willing and, considering the little practice it could have had, 
proved wonderfully adapted to the work.</p>
<p>When the mania for building immense country houses and yachts 
(the owning of opera boxes goes a little further back) first 
attacked this country, the builders imagined that, once 
completed, it would be the easiest, as well as the most 
delightful task to fill them with the pick of their friends, that
they could get all the talented and agreeable people they wanted 
by simply making a sign.&nbsp; To their astonishment, they 
discovered that what appeared so simple was a difficult, as well 
as a thankless labor.&nbsp; I remember asking a lady who had 
owned a &ldquo;proscenium&rdquo; at the old Academy, why she had 
decided not to take a box in the (then) new opera-house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because, having passed thirty years of my life inviting
people to sit in my box, I intend now to rest.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is
very much the same thing with yachts.&nbsp; A couple who had 
determined to go around the world, in their lately finished boat,
were dumbfounded to find their invitations were not eagerly 
accepted.&nbsp; After exhausting the small list of people they 
really wanted, they began with others indifferent to them, and 
even then filled out their number with difficulty.&nbsp; A 
hostess who counts on a series of house parties through the 
autumn months, must begin early in the summer if she is to have 
the guests she desires.</p>
<p>It is just here that the &ldquo;professional,&rdquo; if I may 
be allowed to use such an expression, comes to the front.&nbsp; 
He is always available.&nbsp; It is indifferent to him if he 
starts on a tour around the world or for a winter spree to 
Montreal.&nbsp; He is always amusing, good-humored, and can be 
counted on at the last moment to fill any vacant place, without 
being the least offended at the tardy invitation, for he belongs 
to the class who have discovered &ldquo;how to live well on 
nothing a year.&rdquo;&nbsp; Luxury is as the breath of his 
nostrils, but his means allow of little beyond necessities.&nbsp;
The temptation must be great when everything that he appreciates 
most (and cannot afford) is urged upon him.&nbsp; We should not 
pose as too stern moralists, and throw stones at him; for there 
may enter more &ldquo;best French plate&rdquo; into the 
composition of our own houses than we imagine.</p>
<p>It is here our epoch shows its improvement over earlier and 
cruder days.&nbsp; At present no toad-eating is connected with 
the acceptance of hospitality, or, if occasionally a small 
&ldquo;batrachian&rdquo; is offered, it is so well disguised by 
an accomplished <i>chef</i>, and served on such exquisite old 
Dresden, that it slips down with very little effort.&nbsp; Even 
this rarely occurs, unless the guest has allowed himself to 
become the inmate of a residence or yacht.&nbsp; Then he takes 
his chance with other members of the household, and if the host 
or hostess happens to have a bad temper as a set-off to their 
good table, it is apt to fare ill with our friend.</p>
<p>So far, I have spoken of this class in the masculine, which is
an error, as the art is successfully practised by the weaker sex,
with this shade of difference.&nbsp; As an unmarried woman is in 
less general demand, she is apt to attach herself to one dear 
friend, always sure to be a lady in possession of fine country 
and city houses and other appurtenances of wealth, often of 
inferior social standing; so that there is give and take, the 
guest rendering real service to an ambitious hostess.&nbsp; The 
feminine aspirant need not be handsome.&nbsp; On the contrary, an
agreeable plainness is much more acceptable, serving as a 
foil.&nbsp; But she must be excellent in all games, from golf to 
piquet, and willing to play as often and as long as 
required.&nbsp; She must also cheerfully go in to dinner with the
blue ribbon bore of the evening, only asked on account of his 
pretty wife (by the bye, why is it that Beauty is so often 
flanked by the Beast?), and sit between him and the &ldquo;second
prize&rdquo; bore.&nbsp; These two worthies would have been the 
portion of the hostess fifteen years ago; she would have 
considered it her duty to absorb them and prevent her other 
guests suffering.&nbsp; <i>Mais nous avons chang&eacute; tout 
cela</i>.&nbsp; The lady of the house now thinks first of amusing
herself, and arranges to sit between two favorites.</p>
<p>Society has become much simpler, and especially less 
expensive, for unmarried men than it used to be.&nbsp; Even if a 
hostess asks a favor in return for weeks of hospitality, the 
sacrifice she requires of a man is rarely greater than a 
cotillion with an unattractive d&eacute;butante whom she is 
trying to launch; or the sitting through a particularly dull 
opera in order to see her to the carriage, her lord and master 
having slipped off early to his club and a quiet game of 
pool.&nbsp; Many people who read these lines are old enough to 
remember that prehistoric period when unmarried girls went to the
theatre and parties, alone with the men they knew.&nbsp; This 
custom still prevails in our irrepressible West.&nbsp; It was an 
arrangement by which all the expenses fell on the 
man&mdash;theatre tickets, carriages if it rained, and often a 
bit of supper after.&nbsp; If a youth asked a girl to dance the 
cotillion, he was expected to send a bouquet, sure to cost 
between twenty and twenty-five dollars.&nbsp; What a blessed 
change for the impecunious swell when all this went out of 
fashion!&nbsp; New York is his paradise now; in other parts of 
the world something is still expected of him.&nbsp; In France it 
takes the form of a handsome bag of bon-bons on New Year&rsquo;s 
Day, if he has accepted hospitality during the past year.&nbsp; 
While here he need do absolutely nothing (unless he wishes to), 
the occasional leaving of a card having been suppressed of late 
by our <i>jeunesse dor&eacute;e</i>, five minutes of their 
society in an opera box being estimated (by them) as ample return
for a dinner or a week in a country house.</p>
<p>The truth of it is, there are so few men who &ldquo;go 
out&rdquo; (it being practically impossible for any one working 
at a serious profession to sit up night after night, even if he 
desired), and at the same time so many women insist on 
entertaining to amuse themselves or better their position, that 
the men who go about get spoiled and almost come to consider the 
obligation conferred, when they dine out.&nbsp; There is no more 
amusing sight than poor paterfamilias sitting in the club between
six and seven <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> pretending to read 
the evening paper, but really with his eve on the door; he has 
been sent down by his wife to &ldquo;get a man,&rdquo; as she is 
one short for her dinner this evening.&nbsp; He must be one who 
will fit in well with the other guests; hence papa&rsquo;s 
anxious look, and the reason the editorial gets so little of his 
attention!&nbsp; Watch him as young &ldquo;professional&rdquo; 
lounges in.&nbsp; There is just his man&mdash;if he only happens 
to be disengaged!&nbsp; You will see &ldquo;Pater&rdquo; cross 
the room and shake hands, then, after a few minutes&rsquo; 
whispered conversation, he will walk down to his coup&eacute; 
with such a relieved look on his face.&nbsp; Young 
&ldquo;professional,&rdquo; who is in faultless evening dress, 
will ring for a cocktail and take up the discarded evening paper 
to pass the time till eight twenty-five.</p>
<p>Eight twenty-five, advisedly, for he will be the last to 
arrive, knowing, clever dog, how much <i>&eacute;clat</i> it 
gives one to have a room full of people asking each other, 
&ldquo;Whom are we waiting for?&rdquo; when the door opens, and 
he is announced.&nbsp; He will stay a moment after the other 
guests have gone and receive the most cordial pressures of the 
hand from a grateful hostess (if not spoken words of thanks) in 
return for eating an exquisitely cooked dinner, seated between 
two agreeable women, drinking irreproachable wine, smoking a 
cigar, and washing the whole down with a glass of 1830 brandy, or
some priceless historic madeira.</p>
<p>There is probably a moral to be extracted from all this.&nbsp;
But frankly my ethics are so mixed that I fail to see where the 
blame lies, and which is the less worthy individual, the 
ostentatious axe-grinding host or the interested guest.&nbsp; One
thing, however, I see clearly, viz., that life is very agreeable 
to him who starts in with few prejudices, good manners, a large 
amount of well-concealed &ldquo;cheek&rdquo; and the happy 
faculty of taking things as they come.</p>
<h2>No. 36&mdash;American Society in Italy</h2>
<p>The phrase at the head of this chapter and other sentences, 
such as &ldquo;American Society in Paris,&rdquo; or London, are 
constantly on the lips of people who should know better.&nbsp; In
reality these societies do not exist.&nbsp; Does my reader pause,
wondering if he can believe his eyes?&nbsp; He has doubtless 
heard all his life of these delightful circles, and believes in 
them.&nbsp; He may even have dined, <i>en passant</i>, at the 
&ldquo;palace&rdquo; of some resident compatriot in Rome or 
Florence, under the impression that he was within its mystic 
limits.&nbsp; Illusion!&nbsp; An effect of mirage, making that 
which appears quite tangible and solid when viewed from a 
distance dissolve into thin air as one approaches; like the 
mirage, cheating the weary traveller with a vision of what he 
most longs for.</p>
<p>Forty, even fifty years ago, there lived in Rome a group of 
very agreeable people; Story and the two Greenoughs and Crawford,
the sculptor (father of the brilliant novelist of to-day); 
Charlotte Cushman (who divided her time between Rome and 
Newport), and her friend Miss Stebbins, the sculptress, to whose 
hands we owe the bronze fountain on the Mall in our Park; Rogers,
then working at the bronze doors of our capitol, and many other 
cultivated and agreeable people.&nbsp; Hawthorne passed a couple 
of winters among them, and the tone of that society is reflected 
in his &ldquo;Marble Faun.&rdquo;&nbsp; He took Story as a model 
for his &ldquo;Kenyon,&rdquo; and was the first to note the 
exotic grace of an American girl in that strange setting.&nbsp; 
They formed as transcendental and unworldly a group as ever 
gathered about a &ldquo;tea&rdquo; table.&nbsp; Great things were
expected of them and their influence, but they disappointed the 
world, and, with the exception of Hawthorne, are being fast 
forgotten.</p>
<p>Nothing could be simpler than life in the papal capital in 
those pleasant days.&nbsp; Money was rare, but living as 
delightfully inexpensive.&nbsp; It was about that time, if I do 
not mistake, that a list was published in New York of the 
citizens worth one hundred thousand dollars; and it was not a 
long one!&nbsp; The Roman colony took &ldquo;tea&rdquo; 
informally with each other, and &ldquo;received&rdquo; on stated 
evenings in their studios (when mulled claret and cakes were the 
only refreshment offered; very bad they were, too), and migrated 
in the summer to the mountains near Rome or to Sorrento.&nbsp; In
the winter months their circle was enlarged by a contingent from 
home.&nbsp; Among wealthy New Yorkers, it was the fashion in the 
early fifties to pass a winter in Rome, when, together with his 
other dissipations, paterfamilias would sit to one of the 
American sculptors for his bust, which accounts for the horrors 
one now runs across in dark corners of country 
houses,&mdash;ghostly heads in &ldquo;chin whiskers&rdquo; and 
Roman draperies.</p>
<p>The son of one of these pioneers, more rich than cultivated, 
noticed the other day, while visiting a friend of mine, an 
exquisite eighteenth-century bust of Madame de Pompadour, the 
pride of his hostess&rsquo;s drawing-room.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Midas, &ldquo;are busts the fashion 
again?&nbsp; I have one of my father, done in Rome in 1850.&nbsp;
I will bring it down and put it in my parlor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The travellers consulted the residents in their purchases of 
copies of the old masters, for there were fashions in these 
luxuries as in everything else.&nbsp; There was a run at that 
time on the &ldquo;Madonna in the Chair;&rdquo; and 
&ldquo;Beatrice Cenci&rdquo; was long prime favorite.&nbsp; 
Thousands of the latter leering and winking over her everlasting 
shoulder, were solemnly sent home each year.&nbsp; No one ever 
dreamed of buying an original painting!&nbsp; The tourists also 
developed a taste for large marble statues, &ldquo;Nydia, the 
Blind Girl of Pompeii&rdquo; (people read Bulwer, Byron and the 
Bible then) being in such demand that I knew one block in lower 
Fifth Avenue that possessed seven blind Nydias, all life-size, in
white marble,&mdash;a form of decoration about as well adapted to
those scanty front parlors as a steam engine or a carriage and 
pair would have been.&nbsp; I fear Bulwer&rsquo;s heroine is at a
discount now, and often wonder as I see those old residences 
turning into shops, what has become of the seven white elephants 
and all their brothers and sisters that our innocent parents 
brought so proudly back from Italy!&nbsp; I have succeeded in 
locating two statues evidently imported at that time.&nbsp; They 
grace the back steps of a rather shabby villa in the 
country,&mdash;Demosthenes and Cicero, larger than life, dreary, 
funereal memorials of the follies of our fathers.</p>
<p>The simple days we have been speaking of did not, however, 
outlast the circle that inaugurated them.&nbsp; About 1867 a few 
rich New Yorkers began &ldquo;trying to know the Italians&rdquo; 
and go about with them.&nbsp; One family, &ldquo;up to 
snuff&rdquo; in more senses than one, married their daughter to 
the scion of a princely house, and immediately a large number of 
her compatriots were bitten with the madness of going into 
Italian society.</p>
<p>In 1870, Rome became the capital of united Italy.&nbsp; The 
court removed there.&nbsp; The &ldquo;improvements&rdquo; 
began.&nbsp; Whole quarters were remodelled, and the dear old 
Rome of other days, the Rome of Hawthorne and Madame de 
Sta&euml;l, was swept away.&nbsp; With this new state of things 
came a number of Americo-Italian marriages more or less 
successful; and anything like an American society, properly 
so-called, disappeared.&nbsp; To-day families of our compatriots 
passing the winter months in Rome are either tourists who live in
hotels, and see sights, or go (as far as they can) into Italian 
society.</p>
<p>The Queen of Italy, who speaks excellent English, developed a 
<i>penchant</i> for Americans, and has attached several who 
married Italians to her person in different court capacities; 
indeed, the old &ldquo;Black&rdquo; society, who have remained 
true to the Pope, when they wish to ridicule the new 
&ldquo;White&rdquo; or royal circle, call it the &ldquo;American 
court!&rdquo;&nbsp; The feeling is bitter still between the 
&ldquo;Blacks&rdquo; and &ldquo;Whites,&rdquo; and an American 
girl who marries into one of these circles must make up her mind 
to see nothing of friends or relatives in the opposition 
ranks.&nbsp; It is said that an amalgamation is being brought 
about, but it is slow work; a generation will have to die out 
before much real mingling of the two courts will take 
place.&nbsp; As both these circles are poor, very little 
entertainment goes on.&nbsp; One sees a little life in the 
diplomatic world, and the King and Queen give a ball or two 
during the winter, but since the repeated defeats of the Italian 
arms in Africa, and the heavy financial difficulties (things 
these sovereigns take very seriously to heart), there has not 
been much &ldquo;go&rdquo; in the court entertainments.</p>
<p>The young set hope great things of the new Princess of Naples,
the bride of the heir-apparent, a lady who is credited with being
full of fun and life; it is fondly imagined that she will set the
ball rolling again.&nbsp; By the bye, her first lady-in-waiting, 
the young Duchess del Monte of Naples, was an American girl, and 
a very pretty one, too.&nbsp; She enjoyed for some time the 
enviable distinction of being the youngest and handsomest duchess
in Europe, until Miss Vanderbilt married Marlborough and took the
record from her.&nbsp; The Prince and Princess of Naples live at 
their Neapolitan capital, and will not do much to help things in 
Rome.&nbsp; Besides which he is very delicate and passes for not 
being any too fond of the world.</p>
<p>What makes things worse is that the great nobles are mostly 
&ldquo;land poor,&rdquo; and even the richer ones burned their 
fingers in the craze for speculation that turned all Rome upside 
down in the years following 1870 and Italian unity, when they 
na&iuml;vely imagined their new capital was to become again after
seventeen centuries the metropolis of the world.&nbsp; Whole 
quarters of new houses were run up for a population that failed 
to appear; these houses now stand empty and are fast going to 
ruin.&nbsp; So that little in the way of entertaining is to be 
expected from the bankrupts.&nbsp; They are a genial race, these 
Italian nobles, and welcome rich strangers and marry them with 
much enthusiasm&mdash;just a shade too much, perhaps&mdash;the 
girl counting for so little and her <i>dot</i> for so much in the
matrimonial scale.&nbsp; It is only necessary to keep open house 
to have the pick of the younger ones as your guests.&nbsp; They 
will come to entertainments at American houses and bring all 
their relations, and dance, and dine, and flirt with great good 
humor and persistency; but if there is not a good solid fortune 
in the background, in the best of securities, the prettiest 
American smiles never tempt them beyond flirtation; the season 
over, they disappear up into their mountain villas to wait for a 
new importation from the States.</p>
<p>In Rome, as well as in the other Italian cities, there are, of
course, still to be found Americans in some numbers (where on the
Continent will you not find them?), living quietly for study or 
economy.&nbsp; But they are not numerous or united enough to form
a society; and are apt to be involved in bitter strife among 
themselves.</p>
<p>Why, you ask, should Americans quarrel among themselves?</p>
<p>Some years ago I was passing the summer months on the Rhine at
a tiny German watering-place, principally frequented by English, 
who were all living together in great peace and harmony, until 
one fatal day, when an Earl appeared.&nbsp; He was a poor Irish 
Earl, very simple and unoffending, but he brought war into that 
town, heart-burnings, envy, and backbiting.&nbsp; The English 
colony at once divided itself into two camps, those who knew the 
Earl and those who did not.&nbsp; And peace fled from our little 
society.&nbsp; You will find in every foreign capital among the 
resident Americans, just such a state of affairs as convulsed 
that German spa.&nbsp; The native &ldquo;swells&rdquo; have come 
to be the apple of discord that divides our good people among 
themselves.&nbsp; Those who have been successful in knowing the 
foreigners avoid their compatriots and live with their new 
friends, while the other group who, from laziness, 
disinclination, or principle (?) have remained true to their 
American circle, cannot resist calling the others snobs, and 
laughing (a bit enviously, perhaps) at their upward 
struggles.</p>
<p>It is the same in Florence.&nbsp; The little there was left of
an American society went to pieces on that rock.&nbsp; Our 
parents forty years ago seem to me to have been much more 
self-respecting and sensible.&nbsp; They knew perfectly well that
there was nothing in common between themselves and the Italian 
nobility, and that those good people were not going to put 
themselves out to make the acquaintance of a lot of strangers, 
mostly of another religion, unless it was to be materially to 
their advantage.&nbsp; So they left them quietly alone.&nbsp; I 
do not pretend to judge any one&rsquo;s motives, but confess I 
cannot help regarding with suspicion a foreigner who leaves his 
own circle to mingle with strangers.&nbsp; It resembles too 
closely the amiabilities of the wolf for the lamb, or the sudden 
politeness of a school-boy to a little girl who has received a 
box of candies.</p>
<h2>No. 37&mdash;The Newport of the Past</h2>
<p>Few of the &ldquo;carriage ladies and gentlemen&rdquo; who 
disport themselves in Newport during the summer months, yachting 
and dancing through the short season, then flitting away to fresh
fields and pastures new, realize that their daintily shod feet 
have been treading historic ground, or care to cast a thought 
back to the past.&nbsp; Oddly enough, to the majority of people 
the past is a volume rarely opened.&nbsp; Not that it bores them 
to read it, but because they, like children, want some one to 
turn over its yellow leaves and point out the pictures to 
them.&nbsp; Few of the human motes that dance in the rays of the 
afternoon sun as they slant across the little Park, think of the 
fable which asserts that a sea-worn band of adventurous men, 
centuries before the Cabots or the Genoese discoverer thought of 
crossing the Atlantic, had pushed bravely out over untried seas 
and landed on this rocky coast.&nbsp; Yet one apparent evidence 
of their stay tempts our thoughts back to the times when it is 
said to have been built as a bower for a king&rsquo;s 
daughter.&nbsp; Longfellow, in the swinging verse of his 
&ldquo;Skeleton in Armor,&rdquo; breathing of the sea and the 
Norseman&rsquo;s fatal love, has thrown such a glamour of poetry 
around the tower, that one would fain believe all he 
relates.&nbsp; The hardy Norsemen, if they ever came here, 
succumbed in their struggle with the native tribes, or, 
discouraged by death and hardships, sailed away, leaving the 
clouds of oblivion to close again darkly around this continent, 
and the fog of discussion to circle around the &ldquo;Old 
Mill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The little settlement of another race, speaking another 
tongue, that centuries later sprang up in the shadow of the 
tower, quickly grew into a busy and prosperous city, which, like 
New York, its rival, was captured and held by the English.&nbsp; 
To walk now through some of its quaint, narrow streets is to step
back into Revolutionary days.&nbsp; Hardly a house has changed 
since the time when the red coats of the British officers 
brightened the prim perspectives, and turned loyal young heads as
they passed.</p>
<p>At the corner of Spring and Pelham Streets, still stands the 
residence of General Prescott, who was carried away prisoner by 
his opponents, they having rowed down in whale-boats from 
Providence for the attack.&nbsp; Rochambeau, our French ally, 
lodged lower down in Mary Street.&nbsp; In the tower of Trinity, 
one can read the epitaph of the unfortunate Chevalier de Ternay, 
commander of the sea forces, whose body lies near by.&nbsp; Many 
years later his relative, the Duc de Noailles, when Minister to 
this country, had this simple tablet repaired and made a visit to
the spot.</p>
<p>A long period of prosperity followed the Revolution, during 
which Newport grew and flourished.&nbsp; Our pious and 
God-fearing &ldquo;forbears,&rdquo; having secured personal and 
religious liberty, proceeded to inaugurate a most successful and 
remunerative trade in rum and slaves.&nbsp; It was a triangular 
transaction and yielded a three-fold profit.&nbsp; The simple 
population of that day, numbering less than ten thousand souls, 
possessed twenty distilleries; finding it a physical 
impossibility to drink <i>all</i> the rum, they conceived the 
happy thought of sending the surplus across to the coast of 
Africa, where it appears to have been much appreciated by the 
native chiefs, who eagerly exchanged the pick of their loyal 
subjects for that liquid.&nbsp; These poor brutes were taken to 
the West Indies and exchanged for sugar, laden with which, the 
vessels returned to Newport.</p>
<p>Having introduced the dusky chieftains to the charms of 
delirium tremens and their subjects to life-long slavery, one can
almost see these pious deacons proceeding to church to offer up 
thanks for the return of their successful vessels.&nbsp; Alas! 
even &ldquo;the best laid schemes of mice and men&rdquo; come to 
an end.&nbsp; The War of 1812, the opening of the Erie Canal and 
sundry railways struck a blow at Newport commerce, from which it 
never recovered.&nbsp; The city sank into oblivion, and for over 
thirty years not a house was built there.</p>
<p>It was not until near 1840 that the Middletons and Izzards and
other wealthy and aristocratic Southern families were tempted to 
Newport by the climate and the facilities it offered for bathing,
shooting and boating.&nbsp; A boarding-house or two sufficed for 
the modest wants of the new-comers, first among which stood the 
Aquidneck, presided over by kind Mrs. Murray.&nbsp; It was not 
until some years later, when New York and Boston families began 
to appreciate the place, that the first hotels were 
built,&mdash;the Atlantic on the square facing the old mill, the 
Bellevue and Fillmore on Catherine Street, and finally the 
original Ocean House, destroyed by fire in 1845 and rebuilt as we
see it to-day.&nbsp; The croakers of the epoch considered it much
too far out of town to be successful, for at its door the open 
fields began, a gate there separating the town from the country 
across which a straggling, half-made road, closed by innumerable 
gates, led along the cliffs and out across what is now the Ocean 
Drive.&nbsp; The principal roads at that time led inland; any one
wishing to drive seaward had to descend every two or three 
minutes to open a gate.&nbsp; The youth of the day discovered a 
source of income in opening and closing these for pennies.</p>
<p>Fashion had decreed that the correct hour for dancing was 11 
<span class="smcap">a.m.</span>, and <i>matin&eacute;es 
dansantes</i> were regularly given at the hotels, our 
grandmothers appearing in <i>d&eacute;collet&eacute;</i> muslin 
frocks adorned with broad sashes, and disporting themselves gayly
until the dinner hour.&nbsp; Low-neck dresses were the rule, not 
only for these informal entertainments, but as every-day wear for
young girls,&mdash;an old lady only the other day telling me she 
had never worn a &ldquo;high-body&rdquo; until after her 
marriage.&nbsp; Two o&rsquo;clock found all the beauties and 
beaux dining.&nbsp; How incredulously they would have laughed if 
any one had prophesied that their grandchildren would prefer 
eight forty-five as a dinner hour!</p>
<p>The opening of Bellevue Avenue marked another epoch in the 
history of Newport.&nbsp; About that time Governor Lawrence 
bought the whole of Ochre Point farm for fourteen thousand 
dollars, and Mr. de Rham built on the newly opened road the first
&ldquo;cottage,&rdquo; which stands to-day modestly back from the
avenue opposite Perry Street.&nbsp; If houses have souls, as 
Hawthorne averred, and can remember and compare, what curious 
thoughts must pass through the oaken brain of this simple 
construction as it sees its marble neighbors rearing their vast 
facades among trees.&nbsp; The trees, too, are an innovation, for
when the de Rham cottage was built and Mrs. Cleveland opened her 
new house at the extreme end of Rough Point (the second summer 
residence in the place) it is doubtful if a single tree broke the
rocky monotony of the landscape from the Ocean House to 
Bateman&rsquo;s Point.</p>
<p>Governor Lawrence, having sold one acre of his Ochre Point 
farm to Mr. Pendleton for the price he himself had paid for the 
whole, proceeded to build a stone wall between the two properties
down to the water&rsquo;s edge.&nbsp; The population of Newport 
had been accustomed to take their Sunday airings and moonlight 
rambles along &ldquo;the cliffs,&rdquo; and viewed this 
obstruction of their favorite walk with dismay.&nbsp; So strong 
was their feeling that when the wall was completed the young men 
of the town repaired there in the night and tore it down.&nbsp; 
It was rebuilt, the mortar being mixed with broken glass.&nbsp; 
This infuriated the people to such an extent that the whole 
populace, in broad daylight, accompanied by the summer visitors, 
destroyed the wall and threw the materials into the sea.&nbsp; 
Lawrence, bent on maintaining what he considered his rights, 
called the law to his aid.&nbsp; It was then discovered that an 
immemorial riverain right gave the fishermen and the public 
generally, access to the shore for fishing, and also to collect 
seaweed,&mdash;a right of way that no one could obstruct.</p>
<p>This was the beginning of the long struggle between the 
cliff-dwellers and the townspeople; each new property-owner, 
disgusted at the idea that all the world can stroll at will 
across his well-kept lawns, has in turn tried his hand at 
suppressing the now famous &ldquo;walk.&rdquo;&nbsp; Not only do 
the public claim the liberty to walk there, but also the right to
cross any property to get to the shore.&nbsp; At this moment the 
city fathers and the committee of the new buildings at 
Bailey&rsquo;s Beach are wrangling as gayly as in Governor 
Lawrence&rsquo;s day over a bit of wall lately constructed across
the end of Bellevue Avenue.&nbsp; A new expedient has been hit 
upon by some of the would-be exclusive owners of the cliffs; they
have lowered the &ldquo;walk&rdquo; out of sight, thus insuring 
their own privacy and in no way interfering with the rights of 
the public.</p>
<p>Among the gentlemen who settled in Newport about Governor 
Lawrence&rsquo;s time was Lord Baltimore (Mr. Calvert, he 
preferred to call himself), who remained there until his 
death.&nbsp; He was shy of referring to his English peerage, but 
would willingly talk of his descent through his mother from Peter
Paul Rubens, from whom had come down to him a ch&acirc;teau in 
Holland and several splendid paintings.&nbsp; The latter hung in 
the parlor of the modest little dwelling, where I was taken to 
see them and their owner many years ago.&nbsp; My introducer on 
this occasion was herself a lady of no ordinary birth, being the 
daughter of Stuart, our greatest portrait painter.&nbsp; I have 
passed many quiet hours in the quaint studio (the same her father
had used), hearing her prattle&mdash;as she loved to do if she 
found a sympathetic listener&mdash;of her father, of Washington 
and his pompous ways, and the many celebrities who had in turn 
posed before Stuart&rsquo;s easel.&nbsp; She had been her 
father&rsquo;s companion and aid, present at the sittings, 
preparing his brushes and colors, and painting in backgrounds and
accessories; and would willingly show his palette and explain his
methods and theories of color, his predilection for scrumbling 
shadows thinly in black and then painting boldly in with body 
color.&nbsp; Her lessons had not profited much to the gentle, 
kindly old lady, for the productions of her own brush were far 
from resembling her great parent&rsquo;s work.&nbsp; She, 
however, painted cheerfully on to life&rsquo;s close, surrounded 
by her many friends, foremost among whom was Charlotte Cushman, 
who also passed the last years of her life in Newport.&nbsp; Miss
Stuart was over eighty when I last saw her, still full of spirit 
and vigor, beginning the portrait of a famous beauty of that day,
since the wife and mother of dukes.</p>
<p>Miss Stuart&rsquo;s death seems to close one of the chapters 
in the history of this city, and to break the last connecting 
link with its past.&nbsp; The world moves so quickly that the 
simple days and modest amusements of our fathers and grandfathers
have already receded into misty remoteness.&nbsp; We look at 
their portraits and wonder vaguely at their graceless 
costumes.&nbsp; We know they trod these same streets, and laughed
and flirted and married as we are doing to-day, but they seem to 
us strangely far away, like inhabitants of another sphere!</p>
<p>It is humiliating to think how soon we, too, shall have become
the ancestors of a new and careless generation; fresh faces will 
replace our faded ones, young voices will laugh as they look at 
our portraits hanging in dark corners, wondering who we were, and
(criticising the apparel we think so artistic and appropriate) 
how we could ever have made such guys of ourselves.</p>
<h2>No. 38&mdash;A Conquest of Europe</h2>
<p>The most important event in modern history is the discovery of
Europe by the Americans.&nbsp; Before it, the peoples of the Old 
World lived happy and contented in their own countries, 
practising the patriarchal virtues handed down to them from 
generations of forebears, ignoring alike the vices and benefits 
of modern civilization, as understood on this side of the 
Atlantic.&nbsp; The simple-minded Europeans remained at home, 
satisfied with the rank in life where they had been born, and 
innocent of the ways of the new world.</p>
<p>These peoples were, on the whole, not so much to be pitied, 
for they had many pleasing crafts and arts unknown to the 
invaders, which had enabled them to decorate their capitals with 
taste in a rude way; nothing really great like the lofty 
buildings and elevated railway structures, executed in American 
cities, but interesting as showing what an ingenious race, 
deprived of the secrets of modern science, could accomplish.</p>
<p>The more &aelig;sthetic of the newcomers even affected to 
admire the antiquated places of worship and residences they 
visited abroad, pointing out to their compatriots that in many 
cases marble, bronze and other old-fashioned materials had been 
so cleverly treated as to look almost like the superior cast-iron
employed at home, and that some of the old paintings, preserved 
with veneration in the museums, had nearly the brilliancy of 
modern chromos.&nbsp; As their authors had, however, neglected to
use a process lending itself to rapid reproduction, they were of 
no practical value.&nbsp; In other ways, the continental races, 
when discovered, were sadly behind the times.&nbsp; In business, 
they ignored the use of &ldquo;corners,&rdquo; that backbone of 
American trade, and their ideas of advertising were but little in
advance of those known among the ancient Greeks.</p>
<p>The discovery of Europe by the Americans was made about 1850, 
at which date the first bands of adventurers crossed the seas in 
search of amusement.&nbsp; The reports these pioneers brought 
back of the <i>na&iuml;vet&eacute;</i>, politeness, and 
gullibility of the natives, and the cheapness of existence in 
their cities, caused a general exodus from the western to the 
eastern hemisphere.&nbsp; Most of the Americans who had used up 
their credit at home and those whose incomes were insufficient 
for their wants, immediately migrated to these happy hunting 
grounds, where life was inexpensive and credit unlimited.</p>
<p>The first arrivals enjoyed for some twenty years unique 
opportunities.&nbsp; They were able to live in splendor for a 
pittance that would barely have kept them in necessaries on their
own side of the Atlantic, and to pick up valuable specimens of 
native handiwork for nominal sums.&nbsp; In those happy days, to 
belong to the invading race was a sufficient passport to the good
graces of the Europeans, who asked no other guarantees before 
trading with the newcomers, but flocked around them, offering 
their services and their primitive manufactures, convinced that 
Americans were all wealthy.</p>
<p>Alas!&nbsp; History ever repeats itself.&nbsp; As Mexicans and
Peruvians, after receiving their conquerors with confidence and 
enthusiasm, came to rue the day they had opened their arms to 
strangers, so the European peoples, before a quarter of a century
was over, realized that the hordes from across the sea who were 
over-running their lands, raising prices, crowding the native 
students out of the schools, and finally attempting to force an 
entrance into society, had little to recommend them or justify 
their presence except money.&nbsp; Even in this some of the 
intruders were unsatisfactory.&nbsp; Those who had been received 
into the &ldquo;bosom&rdquo; of hotels often forgot to settle 
before departing.&nbsp; The continental women who had provided 
the wives of discoverers with the raiment of the country (a 
luxury greatly affected by those ladies) found, to their disgust,
that their new customers were often unable or unwilling to offer 
any remuneration.</p>
<p>In consequence of these and many other disillusions, Americans
began to be called the &ldquo;Destroyers,&rdquo; especially when 
it became known that nothing was too heavy or too bulky to be 
carried away by the invaders, who tore the insides from the 
native houses, the paintings from the walls, the statues from the
temples, and transported this booty across the seas, much in the 
same way as the Romans had plundered Greece.&nbsp; Elaborate 
furniture seemed especially to attract the new arrivals, who 
acquired vast quantities of it.</p>
<p>Here, however, the wily natives (who were beginning to 
appreciate their own belongings) had revenge.&nbsp; Immense 
quantities of worthless imitations were secretly manufactured and
sold to the travellers at fabulous prices.&nbsp; The same 
artifice was used with paintings, said to be by great masters, 
and with imitations of old stuffs and bric-a-brac, which the 
ignorant and arrogant invaders pretended to appreciate and 
collect.</p>
<p>Previous to our arrival there had been an invasion of the 
Continent by the English about the year 1812.&nbsp; One of their 
historians, called Thackeray, gives an amusing account of this in
the opening chapters of his &ldquo;Shabby Genteel 
Story.&rdquo;&nbsp; That event, however, was unimportant in 
comparison with the great American movement, although both were 
characterized by the same total disregard of the feelings and 
prejudices of indigenous populations.&nbsp; The English then 
walked about the continental churches during divine service, 
gazing at the pictures and consulting their guide-books as 
unconcernedly as our compatriots do to-day.&nbsp; They also 
crowded into theatres and concert halls, and afterwards wrote to 
the newspapers complaining of the bad atmosphere of those 
primitive establishments and of the long 
<i>entr&rsquo;actes</i>.</p>
<p>As long as the invaders confined themselves to such trifles, 
the patient foreigners submitted to their overbearing and uncouth
ways because of the supposed benefit to trade.&nbsp; The natives 
even went so far as to build hotels for the accommodation and 
delight of the invaders, abandoning whole quarters to their 
guests.</p>
<p>There was, however, a point at which complacency 
stopped.&nbsp; The older civilizations had formed among 
themselves restricted and exclusive societies, to which access 
was almost impossible to strangers.&nbsp; These sanctuaries 
tempted the immigrants, who offered their fairest virgins and 
much treasure for the privilege of admission.&nbsp; The 
indigenous aristocrats, who were mostly poor, yielded to these 
offers and a few Americans succeeded in forcing an 
entrance.&nbsp; But the old nobility soon became frightened at 
the number and vulgarity of the invaders, and withdrew severely 
into their shells, refusing to accept any further bribes either 
in the form of females or finance.</p>
<p>From this moment dates the humiliation of the 
discoverers.&nbsp; All their booty and plunder seemed worthless 
in comparison with the Elysian delights they imagined were 
concealed behind the closed doors of those holy places, visions 
of which tortured the women from the western hemisphere and 
prevented their taking any pleasure in other victories.&nbsp; To 
be received into those inner circles became their chief 
ambition.&nbsp; With this end in view they dressed themselves in 
expensive costumes, took the trouble to learn the 
&ldquo;lingo&rdquo; spoken in the country, went to the extremity 
of copying the ways of the native women by painting their faces, 
and in one or two cases imitated the laxity of their morals.</p>
<p>In spite of these concessions, our women were not received 
with enthusiasm.&nbsp; On the contrary, the very name of an 
American became a byword and an abomination in every continental 
city.&nbsp; This prejudice against us abroad is hardly to be 
wondered at on reflecting what we have done to acquire it.&nbsp; 
The agents chosen by our government to treat diplomatically with 
the conquered nations, owe their selection to political motives 
rather than to their tact or fitness.&nbsp; In the large majority
of cases men are sent over who know little either of the habits 
or languages prevailing in Europe.</p>
<p>The worst elements always follow in the wake of 
discovery.&nbsp; Our settlements abroad gradually became the 
abode of the compromised, the divorced, the socially and 
financially bankrupt.</p>
<p>Within the last decade we have found a way to revenge the 
slights put upon us, especially those offered to Americans in the
capital of Gaul.&nbsp; Having for the moment no playwrights of 
our own, the men who concoct dramas, comedies, and burlesques for
our stage find, instead of wearying themselves in trying to 
produce original matter, that it is much simpler to adapt from 
French writers.&nbsp; This has been carried to such a length that
entire French plays are now produced in New York signed by 
American names.</p>
<p>The great French playwrights can protect themselves by taking 
out American copyright, but if one of them omits this formality, 
the &ldquo;conquerors&rdquo; immediately seize upon his work and 
translate it, omitting intentionally all mention of the real 
author on their programmes.&nbsp; This season a play was produced
of which the first act was taken from Guy de Maupassant, the 
second and third &ldquo;adapted&rdquo; from Sardou, with episodes
introduced from other authors to brighten the mixture.&nbsp; The 
piece thus patched together is signed by a well-known Anglo-Saxon
name, and accepted by our moral public, although the original of 
the first act was stopped by the Parisian police as too immoral 
for that gay capital.</p>
<p>Of what use would it be to &ldquo;discover&rdquo; a new 
continent unless the explorers were to reap some such 
benefits?&nbsp; Let us take every advantage that our proud 
position gives us, plundering the foreign authors, making penal 
settlements of their capitals, and ignoring their foolish customs
and prejudices when we travel among them!&nbsp; In this way shall
we effectually impress on the inferior races across the Atlantic 
the greatness of the American nation.</p>
<h2>No. 39&mdash;A Race of Slaves</h2>
<p>It is all very well for us to have invaded Europe, and 
awakened that somnolent continent to the lights and delights of 
American ways; to have beautified the cities of the old world 
with graceful trolleys and illuminated the catacombs at Rome with
electricity.&nbsp; Every true American must thrill with 
satisfaction at these achievements, and the knowledge that he 
belongs to a dominating race, before which the waning 
civilization of Europe must fade away and disappear.</p>
<p>To have discovered Europe and to rule as conquerors abroad is 
well, but it is not enough, if we are led in chains at 
home.&nbsp; It is recorded of a certain ambitious captain whose 
&ldquo;Commentaries&rdquo; made our school-days a burden, that 
&ldquo;he preferred to be the first in a village rather than 
second at Rome.&rdquo;&nbsp; Oddly enough, <i>we</i> are 
contented to be slaves in our villages while we are conquerors in
Rome.&nbsp; Can it be that the struggles of our ancestors for 
freedom were fought in vain?&nbsp; Did they throw off the yoke of
kings, cross the Atlantic, found a new form of government on a 
new continent, break with traditions, and sign a declaration of 
independence, only that we should succumb, a century later, 
yielding the fruits of their hard-fought battles with craven 
supineness into the hands of corporations and municipalities; 
humbly bowing necks that refuse to bend before anointed 
sovereigns, to the will of steamboat subordinates, the insolence 
of be-diamonded hotel-clerks, and the captious conductor?</p>
<p>Last week my train from Washington arrived in Jersey City on 
time.&nbsp; We scurried (like good Americans) to the ferry-boat, 
hot and tired and anxious to get to our destination; a hope 
deferred, however, for our boat was kept waiting forty long 
minutes, because, forsooth, another train from somewhere in the 
South was behind time.&nbsp; Expostulations were in vain.&nbsp; 
Being only the paying public, we had no rights that those 
autocrats, the officials, were bound to respect.&nbsp; The 
argument that if they knew the southern train to be so much 
behind, the ferry-boat would have plenty of time to take us 
across and return, was of no avail, so, like a cargo of 
&ldquo;moo-cows&rdquo; (as the children say), we submitted 
meekly.&nbsp; In order to make the time pass more pleasantly for 
the two hundred people gathered on the boat, a dusky potentate 
judged the moment appropriate to scrub the cabin floors.&nbsp; 
So, aided by a couple of subordinates, he proceeded to deluge the
entire place in floods of water, obliging us to sit with our feet
tucked up under us, splashing the ladies&rsquo; skirts and our 
wraps and belongings.</p>
<p>Such treatment of the public would have raised a riot anywhere
but in this land of freedom.&nbsp; Do you suppose any one 
murmured?&nbsp; Not at all.&nbsp; The well-trained public had the
air of being in church.&nbsp; My neighbors appeared astonished at
my impatience, and informed me that they were often detained in 
that way, as the company was short of boats, but they hoped to 
have a new one in a year or two.&nbsp; This detail did not 
prevent that corporation advertising our train to arrive in New 
York at three-thirteen, instead of which we landed at four 
o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; If a similar breach of contract had happened
in England, a dozen letters would have appeared in the 
&ldquo;Times,&rdquo; and the grievance been well aired.</p>
<p>Another infliction to which all who travel in America are 
subjected is the brushing atrocity.&nbsp; Twenty minutes before a
train arrives at its destination, the despot who has taken no 
notice of any one up to this moment, except to snub them, becomes
suspiciously attentive and insists on brushing everybody.&nbsp; 
The dirt one traveller has been accumulating is sent in clouds 
into the faces of his neighbors.&nbsp; When he is polished off 
and has paid his &ldquo;quarter&rdquo; of tribute, the next man 
gets up, and the dirt is then brushed back on to number one, with
number two&rsquo;s collection added.</p>
<p>Labiche begins one of his plays with two servants at work in a
salon.&nbsp; &ldquo;Dusting,&rdquo; says one of them, &ldquo;is 
the art of sending the dirt from the chair on the right over to 
the sofa on the left.&rdquo;&nbsp; I always think of that remark 
when I see the process performed in a parlor car, for when it is 
over we are all exactly where we began.&nbsp; If a man should 
shampoo his hair, or have his boots cleaned in a salon, he would 
be ejected as a boor; yet the idea apparently never enters the 
heads of those who soil and choke their fellow-passengers that 
the brushing might be done in the vestibule.</p>
<p>On the subject of fresh air and heat we are also in the hands 
of officials, dozens of passengers being made to suffer for the 
caprices of one of their number, or the taste of some captious 
invalid.&nbsp; In other lands the rights of minorities are often 
ignored.&nbsp; With us it is the contrary.&nbsp; One sniffling 
school-girl who prefers a temperature of 80 degrees can force a 
car full of people to swelter in an atmosphere that is death to 
them, because she refuses either to put on her wraps or to have a
window opened.</p>
<p>Street railways are torture-chambers where we slaves are made 
to suffer in another way.&nbsp; You must begin to reel and plunge
towards the door at least two blocks before your destination, so 
as to leap to the ground when the car slows up; otherwise the 
conductor will be offended with you, and carry you several 
squares too far, or with a jocose &ldquo;Step lively,&rdquo; will
grasp your elbow and shoot you out.&nbsp; Any one who should sit 
quietly in his place until the vehicle had come to a full stop, 
would be regarded by the slave-driver and his cargo as a 
<i>poseur</i> who was assuming airs.</p>
<p>The idea that cars and boats exist for the convenience of the 
public was exploded long ago.&nbsp; We are made, dozens of times 
a day, to feel that this is no longer the case.&nbsp; It is, on 
the contrary, brought vividly home to us that such conveyances 
are money making machines in the possession of powerful 
corporations (to whom we, in our debasement, have handed over the
freedom of our streets and rivers), and are run in the interest 
and at the discretion of their owners.</p>
<p>It is not only before the great and the powerful that we bow 
in submission.&nbsp; The shop-girl is another tyrant who has 
planted her foot firmly on the neck of the nation.&nbsp; She 
respects neither sex nor age.&nbsp; Ensconced behind the bulwark 
of her counter, she scorns to notice humble aspirants until they 
have performed a preliminary penance; a time she fills up in 
cheerful conversation addressed to other young tyrants, only 
deciding to notice customers when she sees their last grain of 
patience is exhausted.&nbsp; She is often of a merry mood, and if
anything about your appearance or manner strikes her critical 
sense as amusing, will laugh gayly with her companions at your 
expense.</p>
<p>A French gentleman who speaks our language correctly but with 
some accent, told me that he found it impossible to get served in
our stores, the shop-girls bursting with laughter before he could
make his wants known.</p>
<p>Not long ago I was at the Compagnie Lyonnaise in Paris with a 
stout American lady, who insisted on tipping her chair forward on
its front legs as she selected some laces.&nbsp; Suddenly the 
chair flew from under her, and she sat violently on the polished 
floor in an attitude so supremely comic that the rest of her 
party were inwardly convulsed.&nbsp; Not a muscle moved in the 
faces of the well-trained clerks.&nbsp; The proprietor assisted 
her to rise as gravely as if he were bowing us to our 
carriage.</p>
<p>In restaurants American citizens are treated even worse than 
in the shops.&nbsp; You will see cowed customers who are anxious 
to get away to their business or pleasure sitting mutely patient,
until a waiter happens to remember their orders.&nbsp; I do not 
know a single establishment in this city where the waiters take 
any notice of their customers&rsquo; arrival, or where the 
proprietor comes, toward the end of the meal, to inquire if the 
dishes have been cooked to their taste.&nbsp; The interest so 
general on the Continent or in England is replaced here by the 
same air of being disturbed from more important occupations, that
characterizes the shop-girl and elevator boy.</p>
<p>Numbers of our people live apparently in awe of their servants
and the opinion of the tradespeople.&nbsp; One middle-aged lady 
whom I occasionally take to the theatre, insists when we arrive 
at her door on my accompanying her to the elevator, in order that
the youth who presides therein may see that she has an escort, 
the opinion of this subordinate apparently being of supreme 
importance to her.&nbsp; One of our &ldquo;gilded youths&rdquo; 
recently told me of a thrilling adventure in which he had 
figured.&nbsp; At the moment he was passing under an awning on 
his way to a reception, a gust of wind sent his hat gambolling 
down the block.&nbsp; &ldquo;Think what a situation,&rdquo; he 
exclaimed.&nbsp; &ldquo;There stood a group of my friends&rsquo; 
footmen watching me.&nbsp; But I was equal to the situation and 
entered the house as if nothing had happened!&rdquo;&nbsp; Sir 
Walter Raleigh sacrificed a cloak to please a queen.&nbsp; This 
youth abandoned a new hat, fearing the laughter of a half-dozen 
servants.</p>
<p>One of the reasons why we have become so weak in the presence 
of our paid masters is that nowhere is the individual allowed to 
protest.&nbsp; The other night a friend who was with me at a 
theatre considered the acting inferior, and expressed his opinion
by hissing.&nbsp; He was promptly ejected by a policeman.&nbsp; 
The man next me was, on the contrary, so pleased with the piece 
that he encored every song.&nbsp; I had paid to see the piece 
once, and rebelled at being obliged to see it twice to suit my 
neighbor.&nbsp; On referring the matter to the box-office, the 
caliph in charge informed me that the slaves he allowed to enter 
his establishment (like those who in other days formed the court 
of Louis XIV.) were permitted to praise, but were suppressed if 
they murmured dissent.&nbsp; In his <i>M&eacute;moires</i>, 
Dumas, <i>p&egrave;re</i>, tells of a &ldquo;first night&rdquo; 
when three thousand people applauded a play of his and one 
spectator hissed.&nbsp; &ldquo;He was the only one I 
respected,&rdquo; said Dumas, &ldquo;for the piece was bad, and 
that criticism spurred me on to improve it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>How can we hope for any improvement in the standard of our 
entertainments, the manners of our servants or the ways of 
corporations when no one complains?&nbsp; We are too much in a 
hurry to follow up a grievance and have it righted.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t pay,&rdquo; &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t got 
the time,&rdquo; are phrases with which all such subjects are 
dismissed.&nbsp; We will sit in over-heated cars, eat vilely 
cooked food, put up with insolence from subordinates, because it 
is too much trouble to assert our rights.&nbsp; Is the spirit 
that prompted the first shots on Lexington Common becoming 
extinct?&nbsp; Have the floods of emigration so diluted our 
Anglo-Saxon blood that we no longer care to fight for 
liberty?&nbsp; Will no patriot arise and lead a revolt against 
our tyrants?</p>
<p>I am prepared to follow such a leader, and have already marked
my prey.&nbsp; First, I will slay a certain miscreant who sits at
the receipt of customs in the box-office of an up-town 
theatre.&nbsp; For years I have tried to propitiate that satrap 
with modest politeness and feeble little jokes.&nbsp; He has 
never been softened by either, but continues to 
&ldquo;chuck&rdquo; the worst places out to me (no matter how 
early I arrive, the best have always been given to the 
speculators), and to frown down my attempts at 
self-assertion.</p>
<p>When I have seen this enemy at my feet, I shall start down 
town (stopping on the way to brain the teller at my bank, who is 
perennially paring his nails, and refuses to see me until that 
operation is performed), to the office of a night-boat line, 
where the clerk has so often forced me, with hundreds of other 
weary victims, to stand in line like convicts, while he chats 
with a &ldquo;lady friend,&rdquo; his back turned to us and his 
leg comfortably thrown over the arm of his chair.&nbsp; Then I 
will take my blood-stained way&mdash;but, no!&nbsp; It is better 
not to put my victims on their guard, but to abide my time in 
silence!&nbsp; Courage, fellow-slaves, our day will come!</p>
<h2>Chapter 40&mdash;Introspection <a name="citation276"></a><a 
href="#footnote276" class="citation">[276]</a></h2>
<p>The close of a year must bring even to the careless and the 
least inclined toward self-inspection, an hour of thoughtfulness,
a desire to glance back across the past, and set one&rsquo;s 
mental house in order, before starting out on another stage of 
the journey for that none too distant bourne toward which we all 
are moving.</p>
<p>Our minds are like solitary dwellers in a vast residence, whom
habit has accustomed to live in a few only of the countless 
chambers around them.&nbsp; We have collected from other parts of
our lives mental furniture and bric-&agrave;-brac that time and 
association have endeared to us, have installed these meagre 
belongings convenient to our hand, and contrived an entrance 
giving facile access to our living-rooms, avoiding the effort of 
a long detour through the echoing corridors and disused salons 
behind.&nbsp; No acquaintances, and but few friends, penetrate 
into the private chambers of our thoughts.&nbsp; We set aside a 
common room for the reception of visitors, making it as cheerful 
as circumstances will allow and take care that the conversation 
therein rarely turns on any subject more personal than the view 
from the windows or the prophecies of the barometer.</p>
<p>In the old-fashioned brick palace at Kensington, a little 
suite of rooms is carefully guarded from the public gaze, swept, 
garnished and tended as though the occupants of long ago were 
hourly expected to return.&nbsp; The early years of 
England&rsquo;s aged sovereign were passed in these simple 
apartments and by her orders they have been kept unchanged, the 
furniture and decorations remaining to-day as when she inhabited 
them.&nbsp; In one corner, is assembled a group of dolls, dressed
in the quaint finery of 1825.&nbsp; A set of miniature cooking 
utensils stands near by.&nbsp; A child&rsquo;s scrap-books and 
color-boxes lie on the tables.&nbsp; In one sunny chamber stands 
the little white-draped bed where the heiress to the greatest 
crown on earth dreamed her childish dreams, and from which she 
was hastily aroused one June morning to be saluted as 
Queen.&nbsp; So homelike and livable an air pervades the place, 
that one almost expects to see the lonely little girl of seventy 
years ago playing about the unpretending chambers.</p>
<p>Affection for the past and a reverence for the memory of the 
dead have caused the royal wife and mother to preserve with the 
same care souvenirs of her passage in other royal 
residences.&nbsp; The apartments that sheltered the first happy 
months of her wedded life, the rooms where she knew the joys and 
anxieties of maternity, have become for her consecrated 
sanctuaries, where the widowed, broken old lady comes on certain 
anniversaries to evoke the unforgotten past, to meditate and to 
pray.</p>
<p>Who, as the year is drawing to its close, does not open in 
memory some such sacred portal, and sit down in the familiar 
rooms to live over again the old hopes and fears, thrilling anew 
with the joys and temptations of other days?&nbsp; Yet, each year
these pilgrimages into the past must become more and more lonely 
journeys; the friends whom we can take by the hand and lead back 
to our old homes become fewer with each decade.&nbsp; It would be
a useless sacrilege to force some listless acquaintance to 
accompany us.&nbsp; He would not hear the voices that call to us,
or see the loved faces that people the silent passages, and would
wonder what attraction we could find in the stuffy, old-fashioned
quarters.</p>
<p>Many people have such a dislike for any mental privacy that 
they pass their lives in public, or surrounded only by sporting 
trophies and games.&nbsp; Some enjoy living in their pantries, 
composing for themselves succulent dishes, and interested in the 
doings of the servants, their companions.&nbsp; Others have 
turned their salons into nurseries, or feel a predilection for 
the stable and the dog-kennels.&nbsp; Such people soon weary of 
their surroundings, and move constantly, destroying, when they 
leave old quarters, all the objects they had collected.</p>
<p>The men and women who have thus curtailed their belongings 
are, however, quite contented with themselves.&nbsp; No doubts 
ever harass them as to the commodity or appropriateness of their 
lodgements and look with pity and contempt on friends who remain 
faithful to old habitations.&nbsp; The drawback to a migratory 
existence, however, is the fact that, as a French saying has put 
it, <i>Ceux qui se refusent les pens&eacute;es s&eacute;rieuses 
tombent dans les id&eacute;es noires</i>.&nbsp; These people are 
surprised to find as the years go by that the futile amusements 
to which they have devoted themselves do not fill to their 
satisfaction all the hours of a lifetime.&nbsp; Having provided 
no books nor learned to practise any art, the time hangs heavily 
on their hands.&nbsp; They dare not look forward into the future,
so blank and cheerless does it appear.&nbsp; The past is even 
more distasteful to them.&nbsp; So, to fill the void in their 
hearts, they hurry out into the crowd as a refuge from their own 
thoughts.</p>
<p>Happy those who care to revisit old abodes, childhood&rsquo;s 
remote wing, and the moonlit porches where they knew the rapture 
of a first-love whisper.&nbsp; Who can enter the chapel where 
their dead lie, and feel no blush of self-reproach, nor burning 
consciousness of broken faith nor wasted opportunities?&nbsp; The
new year will bring to them as near an approach to perfect 
happiness as can be attained in life&rsquo;s journey.&nbsp; The 
fortunate mortals are rare who can, without a heartache or 
regret, pass through their disused and abandoned dwellings; who 
dare to open every door and enter all the silent rooms; who do 
not hurry shudderingly by some obscure corners, and return with a
sigh of relief to the cheerful sunlight and murmurs of the 
present.</p>
<p>Sleepless midnight hours come inevitably to each of us, when 
the creaking gates of subterranean passages far down in our 
consciousness open of themselves, and ghostly inhabitants steal 
out of awful vaults and force us to look again into their faces 
and touch their unhealed wounds.</p>
<p>An old lady whose cheerfulness under a hundred griefs and 
tribulations was a marvel and an example, once told a man who had
come to her for counsel in a moment of bitter trouble, that she 
had derived comfort when difficulties loomed big around her by 
writing down all her cares and worries, making a list of the 
subjects that harassed her, and had always found that, when 
reduced to material written words, the dimensions of her troubles
were astonishingly diminished.&nbsp; She recommended her 
procedure to the troubled youth, and prophesied that his 
anxieties would dwindle away in the clear atmosphere of pen and 
paper.</p>
<p>Introspection, the deliberate unlatching of closed wickets, 
has the same effect of stealing away the bitterness from thoughts
that, if left in the gloom of semi-oblivion, will grow until they
overshadow a whole life.&nbsp; It is better to follow the example
of England&rsquo;s pure Queen, visiting on certain anniversaries 
our secret places and holding communion with the past, for it is 
by such scrutiny only</p>
<blockquote><p><i>That men may rise on stepping-stones</i><br />
<i>Of their dead selves to higher things</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Those who have courage to perform thoroughly this task will 
come out from the silent chambers purified and chastened, more 
lenient to the faults and shortcomings of others, and better 
fitted to take up cheerfully the burdens of a new year.</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
